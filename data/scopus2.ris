AB  - Background: Karst tiankengs serve as a reservoir of biodiversity in the degraded karst landscape areas. However, the microbial diversity of karst tiankengs is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the composition and function of the microbial community in a karst tiankeng. Results: We found that habitat differences inside and outside the karst tiankeng changed the composition and structure of the soil microbial communities, and the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria. The Shannon–Wiener diversity of microbial communities inside and outside the tiankeng was significantly different, and it was higher inside the tiankeng (IT). Venn and LEfSe analysis found that the soil microbial communities inside the tiankeng had 640 more endemic species and 39 more biomarker microbial clades than those identified outside of the tiankeng (OT).Functional prediction indicated that soil microorganisms in outside the tiankeng had a high potential for carbohydrate metabolism, translation and amino acid metabolism. There were biomarker pathways associated with several of human diseases at both IT and OT sites. Except for auxiliary activities (AA), other CAZy classes had higher abundance at IT sites, which can readily convert litter and fix carbon and nitrogen, thereby supporting the development of underground forests. The differences in microbial communities were mainly related to the soil water content and soil total nitrogen. Conclusions: Our results provide a metagenomic overview of the karst tiankeng system and provide new insights into habitat conservation and biodiversity restoration in the area. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Disturbance is one of the fundamental shapers of ecological communities, redistributing resources and resetting successional pathways. Human activities including resources management can influence disturbance regimes and trajectories by actively imposing or suppressing disturbance events or shaping ecosystem recovery via disturbance response. Furthermore, different management objectives may drive different disturbance responses. This suggests that the management jurisdiction to which a land parcel is assigned is likely to influence disturbance management and therefore ecological conditions within that parcel. Here, we combined two exploratory approaches to investigate this linkage. First, we used a systematic literature review to develop a typology of reported disturbance response types and strategies by federal land management agencies in the US. Second, we used Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot data in five multi-jurisdictional ecosystems containing national parks to investigate the relationship between land ownership and large disturbance occurrence and between disturbance and tree growth rate. We found that agencies vary in the diversity of disturbance response tactics they are reported to employ, and disturbance types vary in the diversity of responses reported in the literature. Disturbance occurrence varied by land ownership type across the FIA dataset, and the direction of tree growth rate was influenced by the interaction between ownership type and disturbance occurrence in two of five examined ecosystems. Although our mixed methods approach was purely exploratory and not mechanistic, our findings suggest that disturbance response is one possible route by which management regimes may influence ecological conditions. Efforts to understand and predict ecological heterogeneity across large landscapes must consider variation in the social system as a potential contributor to such patterns. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Overstorey biodiversity is known to drive multiple ecosystem functions in mature forests. However, the role of understorey biodiversity in regulating the soil microbiome and ecosystem multiservices of these ecosystems is virtually unknown. Here, we collected vegetation and soil data from mature plantation Mediterranean pine forests (100 years old) with different combinations of tree and understorey plant species to explore the contribution of overstorey and understorey biodiversity for explaining soil microbiomes and ecosystem multiservices. We found that while overstorey diversity is important for supporting soil-borne pathogen control, forest understorey biodiversity is critical for explaining soil nutrient availability, tree production, and soil-plant mutualistic relationships. Our results highlight the importance of understorey biodiversity for maintaining ecosystem multiservices in mature forests, which should be considered in forest management programs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cistus ladanifer-dominated ecosystems are widely distributed in the Western Mediterranean basin and are affected by recurrent fires. Although these scrublands were traditionally considered unproductive, these systems provide significant ecological benefits via mushroom production, which has increased interest in better understanding these ecosystems to restore and promote productivity. We analyzed 48 plots located in Supra- and MesoMediterranean regions in western Spain to assess the soil fungal community and their ecological drivers using ITS2 rDNA Illumina Miseq. The study plots comprised young (early-stage successional stands), middle- (middle-stage successional stands), and late-stage stands. Shannon diversity index values for total fungi were higher under a MesoMediterranean than under a SupraMediterranean climate type, whereas the richness values for ectomycorrhizal (EcM) taxa were higher in late-stage stands than in the younger stands. EcM community composition was influenced by stand age, climatic variables and edaphic parameters. These C. ladanifer-dominated ecosystems support diverse fungi, including edible species such as Boletus, Lactarius, and Laccaria, under specific precipitation, temperature, and late-stage stand factor conditions. Although forest management cannot modify temperature and precipitation, management strategies that consider mosaic landscapes to reduce the severity of potential fires and that retain late successional stands could provide suitable habitats for promoting fungal diversity, production, and function in these scrubland systems. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Disease combined with drought poses an important threat to plant survival, often compromising success in the restoration of riparian forests. Thus, understanding how biotic and abiotic stressors may affect plant survival and growth performance can greatly increase the success of ecosystem management strategies. The purpose of this study was to understand how two plant species, often used together in restoration of riparian ecosystems but with different ecological preferences, would respond to infection by each of two Phytophthora species in Mediterranean-climate regions, in the absence or presence of a simulated drought. Saplings of the drought resistant species Frangula californica, and of the riparian species Alnus rhombifolia were each inoculated in a greenhouse experiment with one of two Phytophthora species and exposed to two watering regimes. Saplings were allocated to six treatments, combining three levels of pathogen inoculation (no inoculation, inoculation with Phytophthora cactorum and inoculation with Phytophthora crassamura), and two watering regimes (well-watered and drought). The response of A. rhombifolia and F. californica saplings was assessed through the observation of health metrics and morphological parameters. Results showed that both P. cactorum and P. crassamura are important pathogens of A. rhombifolia and F. californica. As expected, drought conditions were the main cause of decline and mortality in A. rhombifolia saplings, while water availability was a facilitator of P. cactorum infection in F. californica saplings. We observed two seemingly contrasting results in A. rhombifolia saplings: infection by Phytophthora spp. decreased survival in well-watered plants, while the opposite was recorded for saplings under drought conditions whose survival increased in Phytophthora-inoculated treatments. Saplings of F. californica were able to cope with drought conditions, even when infected by Phytophthora species and water availability increased root infection and decreased sapling survival. We conclude that the continued use of F. californica and A. rhombifolia in sites infested by Phytophthora species can be beneficial in restoration, if appropriate management actions are adopted. Such actions include avoiding the planting of F. californica saplings in areas subjected to water accumulation, and ensuring that A. rhombifolia is planted in areas where drought stress is minimal and where Phytophthora species are possibly absent. We also emphasize the importance of ensuring that plant stock used in revegetation projects is not infected by Phytophthora species, and that biotic and abiotic risks are assessed prior to restoration actions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Native trees provide a range of benefits, from supporting native wildlife to climate regulation, and many urban natural resource managers prioritize native tree planting and restoration. Ulmus americana (American elm) was once widely planted in American cities but has been decimated by Dutch elm disease (DED; Ophiostoma ulmi). Our study evaluated U. americana establishment and growth across urban landscapes. We planted ramets from three DED-tolerant U. americana genotypes (RV16, RV474, and Sunfield) along an urbanization gradient in Newark, DE and Philadelphia, PA, and assessed physiological and morphological responses. We analyzed how U. americana clone growth, chlorophyll fluorescence, and foliar chemistry relate to impervious surface area, ozone (O3) concentrations, and soil characteristics. The one-year post planting mortality rate was low (4%) demonstrating these elms can withstand urban environmental conditions when provided ample water supply and protection from deer. As expected, the elms differed in growth rate, chlorophyll fluorescence, and foliar chemistry between the cities. Elms planted in Philadelphia had greater photosynthetic capacity in July (Fv/Fm = 0.76) and September (Fv/Fm = 0.75), while Newark elms had greater photosynthetic capacity in August (Fv/Fm = 0.78). Depleted foliar δ13C signatures in Philadelphia suggest elms are experiencing greater fossil-fuel derived atmospheric CO2 than in Newark, possibly contributing to the greater growth rates observed in Philadelphia compared to Newark. Enriched foliar δ15N and greater foliar %N in Philadelphia clones suggest they are experiencing greater N deposition from NOx-derived sources compared to Newark clones. Clones growing in Philadelphia had greater foliar nutrient concentrations despite growing in soils with greater heavy metal concentrations. These foliar-soil chemistry patterns suggest that clones growing in Philadelphia respond positively to urban environmental conditions in a large city, whereas clones growing in Newark may be experiencing N limitation in the first year of growth after planting. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - American beech is facing pressure from a number of emergent health issues including beech bark disease, beech leaf disease, beech leaf mining weevil, and climate and habitat change. Interest has increased in the propagation of American beech in response to the demand for more disease-resistant American beech for use in restoration. This study describes the first steps towards publishing methods for transplanting beech in order to supplement commercially available beech seedlings in an area with multiple agencies depleting the existing stock of slow growing species. American beech seedlings were purchased from a nursery in northern Michigan and were excavated from natural stands in the Hiawatha National Forest. Survival rates for these cohorts were compared after a growing season and by the relative amounts of fine roots present on the trees. Generally, the wildling seedlings had a higher survivability than the purchased bare root seedlings. Future work is proposed that could clarify the conditions leading to the higher survival in these wildling seedlings, including the potential for handling the time or age of the seedlings to influence survival. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Plant endosymbionts (endophytes) influence host plant health and express genotype-dependent ecological relationships with plant hosts. A fungal species intended to confer host plant resistance to a forest pathogen was used as inoculum to test for effects of inoculation on disease resistance, microbiomes, and phytochemistry of a threatened pine species planted in a restoration setting. Correlations of inoculation presence/absence, phytochemistry, spatial location of seedlings, maternal seed sources, and fungal endophytic communities in the foliage of six-year-old whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) seedlings were assessed five years after an experimental inoculation of seedlings with foliar endophytic fungi cultured from whitebark pine trees at Crater Lake National Park, including Paramyrothecium roridum. We hypothesized that P. roridum would modify host microbiomes in a manner that combats white pine blister rust disease. Our assessment of seedlings in the field five years after inoculation allowed us to consider whether inoculation stimulated long-lasting changes in microbiome communities and whether effects varied by seedling genetic family. Tests for effects of endophyte inoculation on disease resistance were inconclusive due to current low levels of rust infection observed at the field site. Foliar fungal endophyte richness and Shannon diversity varied with maternal seed sources. Isotopic stoichiometry and phytochemistry did not vary with seedling spatial proximity, inoculation treatment, or maternal seed family. However, endophyte community composition varied with both seedling spatial proximity and maternal seed sources. Endophytic communities did not vary with the inoculation treatment, and the hypothesized biocontrol was not detected in inoculated seedlings. We draw three conclusions from this work: (1) fungal microbiomes of whitebark pine seedlings across our study site did not vary with host phytochemical signatures of ecophysiological status, (2) the inoculation of P. albicaulis seedlings with a mixture of fungal endophytes did not lead to persistent systemic changes in seedling foliar microbiomes, and (3) in correspondence with other studies, our data suggest that maternal seed source and spatial patterns influence fungal endophyte community composition. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Sugar pine, Pinus lambertiana Douglas, is a keystone species of montane forests from Baja California to southern Oregon. Like other North American white pines, populations of sugar pine have been greatly reduced by the disease white pine blister rust (WPBR) caused by a fungal pathogen, Cronartium ribicola, that was introduced into North America early in the twentieth century. Major gene resistance to WPBR segregating in natural populations has been documented in sugar pine. Indeed, the dominant resistance gene in this species, Cr1, was genetically mapped, although not precisely. Genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) placed in a large scaffold were reported to be associated with the allele for this major gene resistance (Cr1R). Forest restoration efforts often include sugar pine seed derived from the rare resistant individuals (typically Cr1R/Cr1r) identified through an expensive 2-year phenotypic testing program. To validate and geographically characterize the variation in this association and investigate its potential to expedite genetic improvement in forest restoration, we developed a simple PCR-based, diploid genotyping of DNA from needle tissue. By applying this to range-wide samples of susceptible and resistant (Cr1R) trees, we show that the SNPs exhibit a strong, though not complete, association with Cr1R. Paralleling earlier studies of the geographic distribution of Cr1R and the inferred demographic history of sugar pine, the resistance-associated SNPs are marginally more common in southern populations, as is the frequency of Cr1R. Although the strength of the association of the SNPs with Cr1R and thus, their predictive value, also varies with geography, the potential value of this new tool in quickly and efficiently identifying candidate WPBR-resistant seed trees is clear. © 2022 American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face complex socio-economic and environmental threats, making them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Blue Carbon (BC) ecosystems (mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows) provide climate regulation services by sequestering and storing carbon, presenting an opportunity for SIDS to address climate change and implement Paris Agreement commitments in their Covid-19 recovery. BC habitat decline not only reduces carbon sequestration benefits provided, but can also result in sediment disturbance and the release of previously stored carbon back into the atmosphere. In this work, a scenario analysis informed by a stakeholder workshop and scientific and socio-economic expectations is used to assess the economic importance of Grenada's BC (mangroves and seagrasses) over the next 10, 25 and 50 years. Our findings indicate that sequestration benefits are severely diminished under Business-as-Usual habitat loss, but still marginally outweigh losses from carbon emissions, with overall welfare gains of US$0.5–1.9 million over 50 years. To stimulate economic recovery post-pandemic, stakeholders anticipated a realistic scenario of increased habitat decline resulting in overall losses of US$5.4–19.4 million in the next 50 years. However, if ecosystems are maintained, overall carbon benefits could reach US$10.7 million, while a 20% increase in mangroves over the next 25 years provides benefits reaching US$11.1 million between 2020 and 2070. These results demonstrate a significant increase in value when BC ecosystems are maintained and not disturbed, preventing the release of previously stored carbon and enhancing sequestration capacity. Restoration benefits are marginal, compared to conservation, supporting claims that conservation is more cost effective. © 2022

AB  - After maturation, Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Siebold & Zucc.) seeds often cannot disperse to reach a suitable germination site. It is therefore difficult to naturally regenerate by itself and relies on animal dispersal. Squirrels hoard pine seeds as winter food and Korean pine seeds stored for overwintering might become the source of regeneration of the species. From field observations, the pine seeds are the food preference for squirrels during autumn in the Lesser Khingan Mountains in Northeast China. Such preference by squirrels has been attributed to high seed energy content and the ease of seed storage. However, it may also be expected from nutritional aspects that a coevolutionary relationship between squirrels and Korean pine species could be partially explained by the effect of active seed components and their physiological regulatory effects on squirrels. To test this hypothesis, control experiments were carried out to examine the modulatory effects of Korean pine nut oil (PNO) on intestinal microbiota, inflammatory profile and oxidative stress in mice. The results showed that, compared with mice fed a high-fat diet, PNO significantly improved the physical and the healthy state of mice. Histological analysis of the liver and epididymal fat tissue showed that PNO alleviated liver and adipocyte lesions, and inflammation caused by high-fat diets. PNO also significantly decreased atherosclerotic index and ameliorate serum lipid accumulation to prevent cardiovascular disease, which effect the positive control SG group. Moreover, PNO elevated superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzyme activities and reduced malondialdehyde levels in the serum. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that PNO restored intestinal microbiota composition, significantly increasing the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia bacteria. These results suggest that Korean pine seeds not only provide adequate fat, protein and energy for squirrels, but also promote physical health and improve body immunity. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Increasing amounts of silver iodide (AgI) in the environment are expected because of the recent massive expansion of weather modification programs. Concurrently, pharmaceuticals, microplastics, hydrocarbons, and pesticides in terrestrial ecosystems continue contaminating forests and agroforests. Our review supports that AgI induces hormesis, a biphasic dose response characterized by often beneficial low-dose responses and toxic high-dose effects, which adds to the evidence for pharmaceuticals, microplastics, hydrocarbons, and pesticides induced hormesis in numerous species. Doses smaller than the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) positively affect defense physiology, growth, biomass, yields, survival, lifespan, and reproduction. They also lead to negative or undesirable outcomes, including stimulation of pathogenic microbes, pest insects, and weeds with enhanced resistance to drugs and potential negative multi- or trans-generational effects. Such sub-NOAEL effects perplex terrestrial ecosystems managements and may compromise combating outbreaks of disease vectors that can threaten not only forest and agroforestry health but also sensitive human subpopulations living in remote forested areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis, is a beetle that originates from East Asia. Upon invasion to North America in the early 2000s, it killed untold millions of ash trees. In European Russia, EAB was first detected in Moscow in 2003 and proved to have the potential to also kill native European ash (Fraxinus excelsior). The beetle has since spread in all geographic directions, establishing itself in eastern Ukraine by 2019 and possessing potential for further westward spread towards the EU. Apart from the approaching EAB, F. excelsior is currently threatened by the dieback disease (ADB) caused by the invasive ascomycete fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. The infestation by EAB combined with ADB infection is expected to be more lethal than either of them alone, yet the potential consequences are unknown. To date, eastern Ukraine represents the geographic area in which both invasions overlap, thus providing the opportunity for related investigations. The aims of the study were to investigate: (i) the EAB expansion range in Ukraine, (ii) the relative susceptibility of F. excelsior and American ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) to EAB and ADB, and (iii) the combined effect/impact on ash condition imposed by both the pest and disease in the area subjected to the invasion. The results have demonstrated that (i) the invasion of EAB is currently expanding both in terms of newly infested trees and invaded geographic area; (ii) F. excelsior is more resistant to EAB than F. pennsylvanica, while F. excelsior is more susceptible to ADB than F. pennsylvanica; and (iii) the infection by ADB is likely to predispose F. excelsior to the infestation by EAB. It was concluded that inventory and mapping of surviving F. excelsior, affected by both ADB and EAB, is necessary to acquire genetic resources for the work on strategic, long-term restoration of F. excelsior in devastated areas, thereby tackling a possible invasion of EAB to the EU. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Chemical compounds from plants have been used as a medicinal source for various dis-eases. Aromachology is a unique field that studies the olfactory effects after inhaling aromatic com-pounds. Aromatherapy is a complementary treatment methodology involving the use of essential oils containing phytoncides and other volatile organic compounds for various physical and mental illnesses. Phytoncides possess an inherent medicinal property. Their health benefits range from treating stress, immunosuppression, blood pressure, respiratory diseases, anxiety, and pain to anti-microbial, anti-larvicidal, anti-septic, anti-cancer effects, etc. Recent advancements in aromatherapy include forest bathing or forest therapy. The inhalation of phytoncide-rich forest air has been proven to reduce stress-induced immunosuppression, normalize immune function and neuroendocrine hormone levels, and, thus, restore physiological and psychological health. The intricate mechanisms related to how aroma converts into olfactory signals and how the olfactory signals relieve physical and mental illness still pose enormous questions and are the subject of ongoing research. Aromatherapy using the aroma of essential oils/phytoncides could be more innovative and attractive to patients. Moreover, with fewer side effects, this field might be recognized as a new field of complementary medicine in alleviating some forms of physical and mental distress. Essential oils are im-portant assets in aromatherapy, cosmetics, and food preservatives. The use of essential oils as an aromatherapeutic agent is widespread. Detailed reports on the effects of EOs in aromatherapy and their pharmacological effects are required to uncover its complete biological mechanism. This review is about the evolution of research related to phytoncides containing EOs in treating various ailments and provides comprehensive details from complementary medicine. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Leaf abundance of trees plays a dominant role in energy, water and nutrient flux of forest ecosystems, in defining the habitat structure of entrained biota and in mediating interspecific competition among tree species. We quantified leaf abundance of three dominant tree species (Acer saccharum Marsh.; Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.; Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) for 27 years in mature northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA using annual counts of leaves of each species collected in 117 litter traps (0.1 m2, each). We hypothesized that variation in leaf abundance would reflect known disturbance events and canopy dieback episodes. No significant trend in leaf abundance of the three species over 27 years (1993–2019) was observed in seven reference stands despite known canopy dieback of sugar maple and American beech in these stands, indicating that 1) maple decline preceded our sampling interval and 2) expansion of beech understory compensated for canopy dieback caused by beech bark disease. Leaf abundance temporarily declined significantly in response to known disturbances (ice storm, 34 to 47%; late-spring frost, 13 to 16%). Increased leaf abundance, especially for sugar maple (30%), on a watershed where calcium addition restored acidified soils, was probably associated with increased soil pH, Ca availability and decreased Al. The temporal sequence of decline of paper birch at higher elevations following a severe drought in 2002 also was apparent. Leaf abundance based on leaf litterfall in deciduous forests provides a useful indicator of forest ecosystem function and forest health. © 2022

AB  - It is becoming clear that the human gut microbiome is critical to health and well-being, with increasing evidence demonstrating that dysbiosis can promote disease. Increasingly, precision probiotics are being investigated as investigational drug products for restoration of healthy microbiome balance. To reach the distal gut alive where the density of microbiota is highest, oral probiotics should be protected from harsh conditions during transit through the stomach and small intestines. At present, few probiotic formulations are designed with this delivery strategy in mind. This study employs an emerging machine learning (ML) technique, known as active ML, to predict how excipients at pharmaceutically relevant concentrations affect the intestinal proliferation of a common probiotic, Lactobacillus paracasei. Starting with a labelled dataset of just 6 bacteria-excipient interactions, active ML was able to predict the effects of a further 111 excipients using uncertainty sampling. The average certainty of the final model was 67.70% and experimental validation demonstrated that 3/4 excipient-probiotic interactions could be correctly predicted. The model can be used to enable superior probiotic delivery to maximise proliferation in vivo and marks the first use of active ML in microbiome science. © 2022

AB  - The loss of tree health is a global concern with many unknown cascading impacts on the diversity and function of forest ecosystems. Specifically, it is uncertain how the process of tree decline and mortality driven by exotic pathogens might alter the soil microbiome. Here we combined high-throughput sequencing, neighborhood models, and network analysis to explore the impacts of the decline of a Mediterranean tree species, Quercus suber, on the diversity, composition and network structure of soil fungal and bacterial communities in forests invaded by the exotic pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. The belowground footprint of pathogen-driven tree decline implied an increase in the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of both bacteria and fungi, but also a severe reduction of tree-symbiotic fungi and Proteobacteria known to have positive effects on plant growth and disease suppression. Moreover, we detected alterations of the topology of soil microbial networks in declining tree neighborhoods (lower connectivity, higher modularity), with implications for ecosystem function. Our findings reveal the large impacts that moderate levels of tree decline can have on the soil microbiome of invaded forests, and highlight the recovery of a functionally diverse and highly connected soil microbiome as a key target in the restoration of these disturbed systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article examined trust, perceived risks and benefits, and normative acceptance associated with using breeding and genetic engineering (GE) to restore American chestnut (AC) trees. Questionnaires were completed by a random representative sample of the public in the United States (n = 278) and a purposive sample of forest interest groups (FIG) such as scientists and managers (n = 195). These concepts were examined in relation to breeding (breed the AC with chestnut trees from Asia) and GE (add the oxalate oxidase [OxO] gene from bread wheat to the AC) approaches for mitigating chestnut blight and restoring AC trees. The public sample considered adding the gene from bread wheat (GE) to be more beneficial and slightly more acceptable, but also slightly riskier, compared to the breeding approach. The FIGs viewed the breeding approach to be more acceptable, less risky, and more beneficial than the GE approach. The FIGs viewed both approaches as less risky, more beneficial, and more acceptable than did the public sample. Path analysis showed that: (i) perceived environmental benefits were the strongest predictors of normative acceptance of both approaches for the public sample, (ii) perceived environmental risks were the strongest predictors of acceptance of both approaches for the FIGs, (iii) human benefits and risks were mostly unrelated to acceptance, and (iv) trust in government agencies charged with managing forests was only weakly associated with benefits, risks, and acceptance. Implications of these results for both research and management were discussed. © 2021 Society for Risk Analysis.

AB  - The emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis, is an invasive beetle of East Asian origin that has killed millions of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in North America and Russia. In September 2020, EAB was detected in Saint Petersburg, a notable event for the metropolitan city. The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence and ecology of EAB in Saint Petersburg. The presence of two distinct enclave populations of EAB was revealed, each of which has, most likely, been established through separate events of “hitchhiking” via transport vehicles. Following the invasion, the further spread of EAB in Saint Petersburg was slow and locally restricted, most likely due to climatic factors. This spread by “hitchhiking” suggests that the possibility of the further long-distance geographic spread of EAB in the Baltic Sea region (the EU) is high, both by ground transport (120–130 km distance from EU borders) and ferries that transport cars across the Baltic Sea. In certain cases, the development of EAB on Fraxinus excelsior, based on the stem portion colonized, larval densities, number of galleries, exit holes, viable larvae, and emerged adult beetles, was more successful than in Fraxinus pennsylvanica trees. The observed relatively high sensitivity of F. excelsior to EAB, therefore, casts doubt on the efficacy and benefits of the currently ongoing selection and breeding projects against ash dieback (ADB) disease, which is caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. Inventory, mapping, and monitoring of surviving F. excelsior trees infested by both ADB and EAB are necessary to acquire genetic resources for work on the strategic long-term restoration of F. excelsior, tackling the probable invasion of EAB to the EU. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was functionally extirpated from eastern US forests by chestnut blight, caused by a fungus from Asia. As efforts to produce blight-resistant American chestnut germplasm advance, approaches to reintroduce chestnut throughout its former range are being developed. However, chestnut is also quite susceptible to a root disease in the southern half of its former range, and the pathogen that causes the disease (Phytophthora cinnamomi) is expected to move northward as climate warms. Genetic resistance to root rot appears to vary among individual chestnut trees, and the prevalence of resistance is highly uncertain. Because restoration of a self-sustaining chestnut population is ultimately a landscape-scale problem, we used a process-based forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) to conduct experiments to quantify the effects of root rot on the effectiveness of chestnut population restoration efforts in the center of the former range of chestnut under various climate scenarios. We developed a new LANDIS-II extension to simulate root rot-induced tree mortality as a function of temperature and soil moisture. We conducted a factorial simulation experiment with climate and resistance to root rot as factors and found that root rot greatly reduced chestnut biomass on the landscape, even when resistance to root rot infection was at the highest levels currently observed in published studies. Warming climate enhanced the virulence of the pathogen and resulted in a greater reduction in chestnut biomass. Results indicate that root rot has the potential to seriously hamper chestnut restoration efforts if resistance of chestnut is not enhanced through breeding and biotechnology, suggesting restoration efforts will be more successful if targeted to latitudes, elevations, and site conditions where root rot is not expected to be present well into the future, including areas north of the historical chestnut range (Canada). These results demonstrate the vital importance of incorporating root rot resistance into the larger blight resistance breeding program. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of zoonotic origin appear, affect a population and can spread rapidly. At the beginning of 2020, the World Health Organization pronounced an emergency public health advisory because of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak, and declared that COVID-19 had reached the level of a pandemic, rapidly spreading around the world. In order to identify one of the origins of EIDs, and propose some control alternatives, an extensive review was conducted of the available literature. The problem can originate in live animal markets, where animal species of all kinds, from different origins, ecosystems, and taxonomic groups are caged and crowded together, sharing the same unsanitary and unnatural space, food, water, and also the ecto- and endoparasitic vectors of disease. They defecate on each other, leading to the exchange of pathogenic and parasitic microorganisms, forcing interactions among species that should never happen. This is the ideal scenario for causing zoonoses and outbreaks of EIDs. We must start by stopping the illegal collection and sale of wild animals in markets. The destruction of ecosystems and forests also promote zoonoses and outbreaks of EIDs. Science and knowledge should be the basis of the decisions and policies for the development of management strategies. Wildlife belongs in its natural habitat, which must be defended, conserved, and restored at all costs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many ecologically important high elevation five-needle white pine (HEFNP) forests that historically dominated upper subalpine landscapes of western North America are now being impacted by mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus spp.) outbreaks, the exotic disease white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), and altered fire regimes. And more recently, predicted changes in climate may reduce HEFNP habitat and exacerbate adverse impacts of fire, beetles and rust. Management intervention using specially designed tactics implemented at multiple scales (range-wide, landscape, stand, and tree levels) are needed to conserve these keystone tree species. A goal of this intervention is to promote self-sustaining HEFNP ecosystems that have both resilience to disturbances and genetic resistance to white pine blister rust in the face of climate change. Many tools and methods are available for land managers, and in this paper, we summarize possible multi-scaled actions that might be taken as steps toward restoration of these valuable HEFNP forests. Long-term programs, such as inventory, mapping, planning, seed collection, seedling production, education, and research provide the materials for effective restoration at finer scales. Stand- and landscape-level passive and active treatments, such as silvicultural cuttings and prescribed fires in both healthy and declining forests, are described in detail and grouped by objectives, methods, and tactics. And last, there are critical pro-active tree-level actions of planting and protection that may be used alone or together to enhance success of other restoration actions. Administrative, policy, legislative, and societal barriers to implementation of an effective restoration effort are also discussed. © 2021

AB  - Background: Alveolar bone loss and mobility of teeth is commonly observed in periodontitis patients. Regeneration of periodontal intrabony defects is indicated to restore the lost bone and periodontal tissues. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of periodontal intrabony lesions by using nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (NHA) graft and comparing it with open flap debridement (OFD) alone. Materials and Methods: The eligibility criteria encompassed randomized (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Weighted mean differences were calculated for clinical attachment level (CAL) gain, probing pocket depth (PPD) reduction and gingival recession (REC) change, demonstrated as forest plots. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool were used for quality assessment of RCTs and non-randomized trials respectively. Results: From 22 full-text articles identified, three RCTs, one CCT and one retrospective follow-up of RCT were included. All the five papers comprised the quantitative evaluation. The use of NHA graft provided additional CAL gain of 0.96 mm (p = 0.0009) and PPD reduction of 0.97 mm (p < 0.00001) when compared to OFD alone. However, in terms of REC changes, no considerable benefits of NHA graft were demonstrated than OFD alone (p = 0.48). Conclusions: The bioactive NHA graft showed promising results clinically in regenerative periodontology and can be considered for the management of periodontal intrabony defects. The use of NHA graft considerably provided better clinical outcomes in intrabony defects compared to using the OFD alone. Future research investigating NHA graft against other regenerative materials including specific BGs, at longer follow-up periods and bigger sample sizes and in furcation defects warranted. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - This paper emerges from a Marsden project, Let the River Speak, focused on the Waimatā River in Gisborne, bringing insights from mātauranga and wānanga together with a wide range of disciplines to produce innovative and engaged understandings of ki uta ki tai-the life of rivers from the mountains to the sea. In Te Ao Māori, waterways are relational knots/nodes/strands in a meshwork of whakapapa that arises from exchanges between earth and sky, land and sea. This approach acknowledges the relations between the atmosphere, surface water and groundwater, vegetation cover, land use, water quality and quantity, the sea, plants, animals, micro-organisms and people; and rivers as beings in their own right, with their own rights. Let the River Speak is codeveloped with the river by a team including iwi researchers, scholars from earth system science, geomorphology, microbiology and infectious diseases, forest ecology, anthropology, creative practice, and business studies. It is holistic, working across different knowledge systems to understand the full complexity of waterways in relationship with people and other life forms over time. At the same time, it is hopeful, providing a relational framework for actions to restore river and estuarine communities to a state of ora (health, well-being, flourishing). © 2022 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

AB  - Over the past century, fire suppression has facilitated broad ecological changes in the composition, structure, and function of fire-dependent landscapes throughout the eastern US, which are in decline. These changes have likely contributed mechanistically to the enhancement of habitat conditions that favor pathogen-carrying tick species, key wildlife hosts of ticks, and interactions that have fostered pathogen transmission among them and to humans. While the long-running paradigm for limiting human exposure to tick-borne diseases focuses responsibility on individual prevention, the continued expansion of medically important tick populations, increased incidence of tick-borne disease in humans, and emergence of novel tick-borne diseases highlights the need for additional approaches to stem this public health challenge. Another approach that has the potential to be a cost-effective and widely applied but that remains largely overlooked is the use of prescribed fire to ecologically restore degraded landscapes that favor ticks and pathogen transmission. We examine the ecological role of fire and its effects on ticks within the eastern United States, especially examining the life cycles of forest-dwelling ticks, shifts in regional-scale fire use over the past century, and the concept that frequent fire may have helped moderate tick populations and pathogen transmission prior to the so-called fire-suppression era that has characterized the past century. We explore mechanisms of how fire and ecological restoration can reduce ticks, the potential for incorporating the mechanisms into the broader strategy for managing ticks, and the challenges, limitations, and research needs of prescribed burning for tick reduction. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Increasing wildfire size and severity across the western United States has created an environmental and social crisis that must be approached from a transdisciplinary perspective. Climate change and more than a century of fire exclusion and wildfire suppression have led to contemporary wildfires with more severe environmental impacts and human smoke exposure. Wildfires increase smoke exposure for broad swaths of the US population, though outdoor workers and socially disadvantaged groups with limited adaptive capacity can be disproportionally exposed. Exposure to wildfire smoke is associated with a range of health impacts in children and adults, including exacerbation of existing respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, worse birth outcomes, and cardiovascular events. Seasonally dry forests in Washington, Oregon, and California can benefit from ecological restoration as a way to adapt forests to climate change and reduce smoke impacts on affected communities. Recent Findings: Each wildfire season, large smoke events, and their adverse impacts on human health receive considerable attention from both the public and policymakers. The severity of recent wildfire seasons has state and federal governments outlining budgets and prioritizing policies to combat the worsening crisis. This surging attention provides an opportunity to outline the actions needed now to advance research and practice on conservation, economic, environmental justice, and public health interests, as well as the trade-offs that must be considered. Summary: Scientists, planners, foresters and fire managers, fire safety, air quality, and public health practitioners must collaboratively work together. This article is the result of a series of transdisciplinary conversations to find common ground and subsequently provide a holistic view of how forest and fire management intersect with human health through the impacts of smoke and articulate the need for an integrated approach to both planning and practice. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Corylus avellana L. is one of the most cultivated species in the world. Mainly utilized with the purpose of obtaining food material, hazel trees cannot guarantee constant kernels productions given the threats related to pathogens and to adverse conditions, especially in a globalisation and global changes scenarios. This matter led us to consider the opportunity of using hazel tree in all its parts and for several purposes, due to its multifunctional characteristics. As a pioneer species, it is a precious plant useful for forest restoration purposes and for forest successions/wildlife facilitation. Its roots enter into symbiosis with truffles making this species exploitable for hazelnuts and truffles production. The precious elements contained in what is considered “waste” deriving from hazel crops (i.e., leaves, skins, shells, husks and pruning material), could be reused and valorised in the perspective of a circular economy that is opposed to a linear one. In particular, a list of several phenolic compounds detected in hazelnut shells has been reported in literature to prevent and delay many human diseases due to their antioxidant properties and to free radical scavenging activities, with implications potentially useful even in the fight against COVID-19. All this makes hazel crop by-products interesting to be valorised as a chemical compound source for human health, even more than a biomass fuel or for bio-char applications. The multiple possible uses of the hazel tree would lead to alternative productions than the only nut productions, avoiding significant economic losses, would decrease the cost of disposal of crops residues and would increase the sustainability of agro-ecosystems by reducing, among other things, the production of wastes and of greenhouse gases deriving from the usual burning of residues which often happens directly in fields. © 2022 Frontiers in Bioscience.

AB  - Objective: To perform a comprehensive review of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in dentistry, providing the community with a broad insight on the different advances that these technologies and tools have produced, paying special attention to the area of esthetic dentistry and color research. Materials and methods: The comprehensive review was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, for papers published in English language in the last 20 years. Results: Out of 3871 eligible papers, 120 were included for final appraisal. Study methodologies included deep learning (DL; n = 76), fuzzy logic (FL; n = 12), and other ML techniques (n = 32), which were mainly applied to disease identification, image segmentation, image correction, and biomimetic color analysis and modeling. Conclusions: The insight provided by the present work has reported outstanding results in the design of high-performance decision support systems for the aforementioned areas. The future of digital dentistry goes through the design of integrated approaches providing personalized treatments to patients. In addition, esthetic dentistry can benefit from those advances by developing models allowing a complete characterization of tooth color, enhancing the accuracy of dental restorations. Clinical significance: The use of AI and ML has an increasing impact on the dental profession and is complementing the development of digital technologies and tools, with a wide application in treatment planning and esthetic dentistry procedures. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for a wide range of ecological processes, including to disease spread, once it describes the degree to which landscapes facilitate or impede vector and hosts dispersion. Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. © 2021 British Ecological Society

AB  - Hands are vital in a wide range of fundamental daily activities, and neurological diseases that impede hand function can significantly affect quality of life. Wearable hand gesture interfaces hold promise to restore and assist hand function and to enhance human-human and human-computer communication. The purpose of this review is to synthesize current novel sensing interfaces and algorithms for hand gesture recognition, and the scope of applications covers rehabilitation, prosthesis control, exoskeletons for augmentation, sign language recognition, human-computer interaction, and user authentication. Results showed that electrical, mechanical, acoustical/vibratory, and optical sensing were the primary input modalities in gesture recognition interfaces. Two categories of algorithms were identified: 1) classification algorithms for predefined, fixed hand poses and 2) regression algorithms for continuous finger and wrist joint angles. Conventional machine learning algorithms, including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, random forests, and non-negative matrix factorization, have been widely used for a variety of gesture recognition applications, and deep learning algorithms have more recently been applied to further facilitate the complex relationship between sensor signals and multi-articulated hand postures. Future research should focus on increasing recognition accuracy with larger hand gesture datasets, improving reliability and robustness for daily use outside of the laboratory, and developing softer, less obtrusive interfaces. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Collateral vessels play an important role in the restoration of blood flow to the ischemic tissues of stroke patients, and the quality of collateral flow has major impact on reducing treatment delay and increasing the success rate of reperfusion. Due to high spatial resolution and rapid scan time, advance imaging using the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is gaining more attention over the conventional angiography in acute stroke diagnosis. Detecting collateral vessels from CBCT images is a challenging task due to the presence of noises and artifacts, small-size and non-uniform structure of vessels. This paper presents a technique to objectively identify collateral vessels from non-collateral vessels. In our technique, several filters are used on the CBCT images of stroke patients to remove noises and artifacts, then multiscale top-hat transformation method is implemented on the pre-processed images to further enhance the vessels. Next, we applied three types of feature extraction methods which are gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), moment invariant, and shape to explore which feature is best to classify the collateral vessels. These features are then used by the support vector machine (SVM), random forest, decision tree, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers to classify vessels. Finally, the performance of these classifiers is evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, precision, recall, F-Measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Our results show that all classifiers achieve promising classification accuracy above 90% and able to detect the collateral and non-collateral vessels from images. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Black alder (Alnus glutinosa) forests are in severe decline across their area of distribution due to a disease caused by the soil-borne pathogenic Phytophthora alni species complex (class Oomycetes), “alder Phytopththora”. Mapping of the different types of damages caused by the disease is challenging in high density ecosystems in which spectral variability is high due to canopy heterogeneity. Data obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be particularly useful for such tasks due to the high resolution, flexibility of acquisition and cost efficiency of this type of data. In this study, A. glutinosa decline was assessed by considering four categories of tree health status in the field: asymptomatic, dead and defoliation above and below a 50% threshold. A combination of multispectral Parrot Sequoia and UAV unmanned aerial vehicles -red green blue (RGB) data were analysed using classical random forest (RF) and a simple and robust three-step logistic modelling approaches to identify the most important forest health indicators while adhering to the principle of parsimony. A total of 34 remote sensing variables were considered, including a set of vegetation indices, texture features from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a digital surface model (DSM), topographic and digital aerial photogrammetry-derived structural data from the DSM at crown level. Results: The four categories identified by the RF yielded an overall accuracy of 67%, while aggregation of the legend to three classes (asymptomatic, defoliated, dead) and to two classes (alive, dead) improved the overall accuracy to 72% and 91% respectively. On the other hand, the confusion matrix, computed from the three logistic models by using the leave-out cross-validation method yielded overall accuracies of 75%, 80% and 94% for four-, three- and two-level classifications, respectively. Discussion: The study findings provide forest managers with an alternative robust classification method for the rapid, effective assessment of areas affected and non-affected by the disease, thus enabling them to identify hotspots for conservation and plan control and restoration measures aimed at preserving black alder forests. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Emerging evidence indicates an association between gut microbiome and arthritis diseases including gout. However, how and which gut bacteria affect host urate degradation and inflammation in gout remains unclear. Here we performed a metagenome analysis on 307 fecal samples from 102 gout patients and 86 healthy controls. Gout metagenomes significantly differed from those of healthy controls. The relative abundances of Prevotella, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides were increased in gout, whereas those of Enterobacteriaceae and butyrate-producing species were decreased. Functionally, gout patients had greater abundances for genes in fructose, mannose metabolism and lipid A biosynthesis, and lower for genes in urate degradation and short chain fatty acid production. A three-pronged association between metagenomic species, functions and clinical parameters revealed that decreased abundances of species in Enterobacteriaceae were associated with reduced amino acid metabolism and environmental sensing, which together contribute to increased serum uric acid and C-reactive protein levels in gout. A random forest classifier based on three gut microbial genes showed high predictivity for gout in both discovery and validation cohorts (0.91 and 0.80 accuracy), with high specificity in the context of other chronic disorders. Longitudinal analysis showed that uric-acid-lowering and anti-inflammatory drugs partially restored gut microbiota after 24-week treatment. Comparative analysis with obesity, type 2 diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis indicated that gout metagenomes were more similar to those of autoimmune than metabolic diseases. Our results suggest that gut dysbiosis was associated with dysregulated host urate degradation and systemic inflammation and may be used as non-invasive diagnostic markers for gout. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Mangroves buffer inland ecosystems from hurricane winds and storm surge. However, their ability to withstand harsh cyclone conditions depends on plant resilience traits and geomorphology. Using airborne lidar and satellite imagery collected before and after Hurricane Irma, we estimated that 62% of mangroves in southwest Florida suffered canopy damage, with largest impacts in tall forests (>10 m). Mangroves on well-drained sites (83%) resprouted new leaves within one year after the storm. By contrast, in poorly-drained inland sites, we detected one of the largest mangrove diebacks on record (10,760 ha), triggered by Irma. We found evidence that the combination of low elevation (median = 9.4 cm asl), storm surge water levels (>1.4 m above the ground surface), and hydrologic isolation drove coastal forest vulnerability and were independent of tree height or wind exposure. Our results indicated that storm surge and ponding caused dieback, not wind. Tidal restoration and hydrologic management in these vulnerable, low-lying coastal areas can reduce mangrove mortality and improve resilience to future cyclones. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - White pine blister rust, caused by the non-native, invasive fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola, is a significant cause of mortality in white pines (Pinus subgenus Strobus) in North America. Along with climate-driven range contraction, mortality from blister rust can seriously impact the abundance and distribution of the nine white pine species native to the United States and Canada. Very little evaluation of this disease in southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis) has been previously undertaken, but genetic resistance to the disease has been documented, including major gene resistance (MGR) conferred by a dominant R gene. Data is emerging suggesting that the species also has quantitative disease resistance (QR). Our results suggest QR occurs at low frequency, with perhaps 10% of trees having a moderate level (> 35% survival). We assessed progeny arrays from 40 P. strobiformis families (1873 seedlings), originating from three populations, inoculated with C. ribicola. Subsequently, the seedlings were assessed for signs, symptoms and resulting impact in a common garden trial over a 7.5-year period to determine the types and frequency of resistance in a portion of this species’ range. There was a high incidence of both stem symptoms and mortality in the P. strobiformis families tested, and families ranged in survival from 0 to 84.6%. Three families had > 70% survival, representing perhaps the highest documented QR to date in a North American white pine species. Approximately 29.1% of the 441 surviving seedlings showed no stem symptoms, and of the approximately 70.8% of seedlings surviving with infections only few (24 of 316) had infections of moderate to high severity. QR traits associated with improved survival were primarily related to lower severity of infection, a reduced number of stem symptoms, and an increased number of bark reactions. Despite the high overall susceptibility, the presence of QR appears to be at a frequency and level useful to forest managers involved in restoration and reforestation efforts.

AB  - The Himalayan Mountains are geodynamical important, featuring a wide climatic range with a rich diversity of flora, fauna, human communities, culture, and social set-up. In recent decades, due to constant anthropogenic pressure and considerable changes witnessed in the climate of the region, species of this region are threatened. Here, we assessed the impact of nomadic settlement and associated disturbances on plant species composition, diversity parameters, ecosystem properties, and fire incidence in high-altitude forests of Western Himalaya, India. Based on the distance between nomadic settlement location and forest, we classified forest as near nomadic settlement (NNS) or away nomadic settlement (ANS) forest types. We found a significant variation in plant species composition between forest types. Three species, namely, Sibbaldia cuneata, Poa annua, and Abies pindrow, contribute 25% of the cumulative variation in plant species composition. Studying live plants, we found a significant difference only for density, in which ANS had a higher average density than NNS. Considering dead plants, we found a significant difference in all nine plant-related parameters evaluated between sites. NNS had a higher value of all parameters evaluated, except for height, which was higher in ANS sites. ANS forest type show 1.3 times more average carbon stock (160.39 ± 59.03 MgCha−1; mean ± SD) than NNS forest type (120.40 ± 51.74 MgCha−1). We found a significant difference in plant diversity evaluated between forest types. ANS had higher values of Margalef and Fisher diversity but lower values of evenness. We found that NSS had significantly higher values of fire incidences, whereas ANS has a higher normalized differential vegetation index and enhanced vegetation index. Overall, our study showed that species composition, diversity, and fire incidence are strongly impacted due to nomadic settlements. These findings are paramount for designing appropriate livelihood options for indigenous communities and management policies of the long-term forest harvest to achieve global goals and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration targets (2021–2030) to protect the sustainable development of forest mountainous regions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Five-needle white pine species provide important ecosystem services throughout the western U.S., and many of these species have become susceptible to stressors including warmer temperatures, insect epidemics, nonnative disease, and altered disturbance regimes. The objective of this study was to characterize recent broad-scale demographic patterns, including species abundance (i.e., numbers of individuals, tree density, size-class distributions, recruitment, growth rates, mortality rates, and causes of mortality, for the six species of five-needle pine that occur in the western US. We used the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) dataset, spanning greater than 10 years, to quantify demographic status and trends for each species. FIA data were compiled from a probabilistic sample design and consistent analysis framework that included not only the dominant community types of five-needle pines, but also all other forest community types, which have previously been demonstrated to encompass abundant regeneration of five-needle pine species. Our analysis revealed similar trends for whitebark and limber pines: both species exhibited increased levels of mortality that are occurring faster than growth of surviving trees, as well as abundant regeneration in forest types that are not dominated by five-needle pines. Although limber pine has experienced lower mortality rates than whitebark pine, it nonetheless showed signs of decline that are comparable to broad-scale indicators exhibited by whitebark pine 10 years prior. In contrast to whitebark and limber pines, Great Basin bristlecone and foxtail pine mortality rates were relatively low, and their populations exhibited a flat diameter distribution except for restricted recruitment from seedling to sapling size-classes. Our findings suggest that five-needle white pine species would benefit not only from increased seedling recruitment, but also from enhanced recruitment among older and larger age and size classes. Thus, it may be important to apply a variety of management strategies – including artificial regeneration with disease-resistant seedlings, direct seeding, and early intervention to decrease competition that may allow natural regeneration to achieve recruitment inter large size-classes – and also apply silviculture techniques to forest types that may be dominated by other species. The consistent monitoring conducted by FIA can allow future assessment of the demographic trajectory of each five-needle pine species, and thus can help prioritize management and restoration priorities, both within communities dominated by five-needle pines and in other community types that may be important targets for silvicultural interventions or restoration treatments. © 2021

AB  - The niche for Buddha is an important part of the cultural relics in the grottoes, but it has caused serious spalling disease due to human activities and natural disasters. This paper presents a new quantitative evaluation method for the spalling disease of niche for Buddha. First, the random forest-based method was used to identify the niche for Buddha . Then, the spatial clustering of the head of the niche for Buddha was performed by DBSCAN, and the reference surface was determined by the RANSAC algorithm. Based on this, the spallation depth of the grotto surface was extracted and the relevant index elements were established. The experiment of point cloud data in Cave 18 of Yungang Grottoes proves the rationality of this method, which is of great significance to the protection and virtual restoration of cultural relics in grottoes. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

AB  - Heterogeneity among individual patients presents a fundamental challenge to effective treatment, since a treatment protocol working for a portion of the population often fails in others. We hypothesize that a computational pipeline integrating mathematical modeling and machine learning could be used to address this fundamental challenge and facilitate the optimization of individualized treatment protocols. We tested our hypothesis with the neuroendocrine systems controlled by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. With a synergistic combination of mathematical modeling and machine learning (ML), this integrated computational pipeline could indeed efficiently reveal optimal treatment targets that significantly contribute to the effective treatment of heterogeneous individuals. What is more, the integrated pipeline also suggested quantitative information on how these key targets should be perturbed. Based on such ML revealed hints, mathematical modeling could be used to rationally design novel protocols and test their performances. We believe that this integrated computational pipeline, properly applied in combination with other computational, experimental and clinical research tools, can be used to design novel and improved treatment against a broad range of complex diseases. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang.

AB  - Currently, human being activities have impaired ecosystem´s resistance capacity to ecological disturbances at global scale. Human impact during the last century has caused an unprecedent rate of transformation of temperate and tropical forest at different scales, mainly due to deforestation. Humanity´s exponential population growth rate and dramatic social inequity represent important challenges for achieving sustainability goals, given increased and uneven use of resources. In addition, land use change increases the population´s risk to be affected by zoonotic emergent disease in tropical and temperate regions, which represents a public held issue. Therefore, landscape connectivity plays a key role not only in biodiversity conservation and maintenance of ecological functions, making the development of tools for land analysis and land use planning. This would allow the restoration of ecosystems, the creation of ecological corridors mainly for the protection of larger wildlife, as well as reducing the potential risk of zoonoses and the development of multidisciplinary studies. © 2021 Los Autores.

AB  - Ticks are increasingly reported in urban and peri-urban areas, such as city parks or peri-urban forests, across Europe. Land use changes, like the transformation of natural ecosystems into residential or recreational areas, and the restoration of natural areas connectivity for biodiversity purposes, facilitate human contact with these vectors. We evaluated the infestation by Ixodid ticks and their infection by zoonotic agents in two natural reserves (La Mandria and Stupinigi) in the urban area of Turin, northwestern Italy, near to densely inhabited suburbs and consistently frequented by people. We monthly performed dragging in 15 sites during a three-year period (2012–2014). Over 4000 ticks were collected, belonging to the species: Ixodes ricinus, I. acuminatus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, and Haemaphysalis concinna. The tick burden in La Mandria, a park very rich in wildlife, was higher than in Stupinigi, which is surrounded by a grid of roads and cultivated fields. The occurrence of I. ricinus nymphs was mainly related to habitat diversity and seasonal variation but weakly influenced by wildlife presence. Conversely, the density of I. ricinus nymphs were effectively estimated by vegetation coverage, micro-climatic conditions, and the presence of large wildlife. Molecular analyses showed the infections by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (24.1 %), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2.9 %), and Spotted Fever Group rickettsiae (30.4 %) in I. ricinus. Tick-borne encephalitis virus, that is considered so far absent in northwestern Italy, was not detected. In La Mandria, the risk of encountering one I. ricinus nymph infected by Borrelia burgorferi s.l. in 100 m2 was 59.1 % (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 36.3–83.0), and 71.3 % (95%CI: 44.5–93.0) for Rickettsia spp. Educational programs on personal protection and surveillance on tick-borne diseases should be enhanced to face the threat posed by tick vectors in green urban landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - A sustainable healthcare focuses on enhancing and restoring public health parameters thereby reducing gloomy impacts on social, economic and environmental elements of a sustainable city. Though it has uplifted public health, yet the rise of chronic diseases is a concern in sustainable cities. In this work, a sustainable lung cancer detection model is developed to integrate the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) and computational intelligence, causing the least harm to the environment. IoHT unit retains connectivity continuously generates data from patients. Heuristic Greedy Best First Search (GBFS) algorithm is used to select most relevant attributes of lung cancer data upon which random forest algorithm is applied to classify and differentiates lung cancer affected patients from normal ones based on detected symptoms. It is observed during the experiment that the GBFS-Random forest model shows a promising outcome. While an optimal accuracy of 98.8 % was generated, simultaneously, the least latency of 1.16 s was noted. Specificity and sensitivity recorded with the proposed model on lung cancer data are 97.5 % and 97.8 %, respectively. The mean accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and f-score value recorded is 96.96 %, 96.26 %, 96.34 %, and 96.32 %, respectively, over various types of cancer datasets implemented. The developed smart and intelligent model is sustainable. It reduces unnecessary manual overheads, safe, preserves resources and human resources, and assists medical professionals in quick and reliable decision making on lung cancer diagnosis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil microorganisms play crucial role in maintaining the global nutrient cycle. Soil health status and its nutrient pool rely upon soil microbial community structure and function. Majority of microbes are associated symbiotically with diverse plant and animal species to maintain the growth of plants as well as their own. Soil microorganisms are highly responsible to regulate the plant metabolism and signaling by producing various metabolic compounds, which facilitate growth of plant and also provides immunity against plant diseases. Bamboo is a taxonomic group of plants which is widely distributed in many tropical and subtropical regions. The rhizospheric microbial communities of the bamboo play significant role in the immobilization of various soil nutrients and also enhances the phytoremediation and environmental restoration capability of bamboo. In this regard, the present review critically spotted light on the plant microbial interactions with major emphasis on the bamboo plantation. The diversity of bacteria and fungi in bamboo cultivated forest and how bamboo cultivation influences the microbial community's dynamic of the soil are critically discussed in the present review. Furthermore, this review cover-up various advance tools and technologies deployed in characterization of bamboo rhizospheric microbial communities. Finally, this review comprehensively explored the phytoremediation and environmental management aspects of bamboo/bamboo biomass along with prospects for the future research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Replanting trees helps with avoiding desertification, reducing the chances of soil erosion and flooding, minimizing the risks of zoonotic disease outbreaks, and providing ecosystem services and livelihood to the indigenous people, in addition to sequestering carbon dioxide for mitigating climate change. Consequently, it is important to explore new methods and technologies that are aiming to upscale and fast‐track afforestation and reforestation (A/R) endeavors, given that many of the current tree planting strategies are not cost effective over large landscapes, and suffer from constraints associated with time, energy, manpower, and nursery‐based seedling production. UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)‐supported seed sowing (UAVsSS) can promote rapid A/R in a safe, cost-effective, fast and environmentally friendly manner, if performed correctly, even in otherwise un-safe and/or inaccessible terrains, supplementing the overall manual planting efforts globally. In this study, we reviewed the recent literature on UAVsSS, to analyze the current status of the technology. Primary UAVsSS applications were found to be in areas of post‐wildfire reforestation, mangrove restoration, forest restoration after degradation, weed eradication, and desert greening. Nonetheless, low survival rates of the seeds, future forest diversity, weather limitations, financial constraints, and seed‐firing accuracy concerns were determined as major challenges to operationalization. Based on our literature survey and qualitative analysis, twelve recommendations—ranging from the need for publishing germination results to linking UAVsSS operations with carbon offset markets—are provided for the advancement of UAVsSS applications. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The complex effects of global environmental changes on ecosystems result from the interaction of multiple stressors, their direct impacts on species and their indirect impacts on species interactions. Air pollution (and resulting depletion of soil base cations) and biotic invasion (e.g. beech bark disease [BBD] complex) are two stressors that are affecting the foundational tree species of northern hardwood forests, sugar maple and American beech, in northeastern North America. At the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, a watershed-scale calcium (Ca) addition in 1999 restored soil Ca that had been lost as a result of acid deposition in a maple-beech forest that was severely affected by BBD beginning in the 1970s. We present historic data from the reference watershed for BBD progression, 20 years of comparative forest data from the treated and reference watersheds, and tree demographic rates for the most recent decade. We hypothesized that mitigation of soil acidification on the treated watershed in the presence of BBD would favour improved performance of sugar maple, a species that is particularly sensitive to base cation depletion. We observed significant responses of seed production, seedling bank composition, sapling survival and recruitment, and tree mortality and growth to the restoration of soil Ca, indicating that acid rain depletion of soil base cations has influenced demographic rates of maple and beech. Overall, the reduced performance of sugar maple on acidified soils may indirectly favour the persistence of diseased beech trees and a greater abundance of beech vegetative sprouts, effectively promoting the chronic presence of severe BBD in the population. Synthesis. The shifting conditions created by global change have altered long-term demographic rates and may thereby impact competitive interactions in the current centre of these species ranges and have more profound implications for species persistence and migration potential than previously anticipated. © 2021 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Macroalgal forests play a key role in shallow temperate rocky reefs worldwide, supporting communities with high productivity and providing several ecosystem services. Sea urchin grazing has been increasingly influencing spatial and temporal variation in algae distributions and it has become the main cause for the loss of these habitats in many coastal areas, causing a phase shift from macroalgae habitats to barren grounds. The low productive barrens often establish as alternative stable states and only a major reduction in sea urchin density can trigger the recovery of macroalgal forests. The present study aims to assess if the 2018 disease outbreak, responsible for a strong reduction in the sea urchin Diadema africanum densities in Madeira Island, was able to trigger a reverse shift from barren grounds into macroalgae-dominated state. By assessing the diversity and abundance of benthic sessile organisms, macroinvertebrates and fishes before, during and after that particular mass mortality event, we evaluate changes in benthic assemblages and relate them to variations in grazer and herbivore densities. Our results revealed a clear shift from barren state to a macroalgae habitat, with barrens characterized by bare substrate, sessile invertebrate and Crustose Coralline Algae (CCA) disappearing after the mortality event. Overall variations in benthic assemblages was best explained by four taxa (among grazers and herbivores species). However, it was the 2018 demise of D. africanum and its density reduction that most contributed to the reverse shift from a long stable barren state to a richer benthic assemblage with higher abundance of macroalgae. Despite this recent increase in macroalgae dominated habitats, their stability and persistence in Madeira Island is fragile, since it was triggered by an unpredictable disease outbreak and depends on how D. africanum populations will recover. With no control mechanisms, local urchin populations can easily reach the tipping point needed to promote a new shift into barren states. New conservation measures and active restoration are likely required to maintain and promote the local stability of macroalgal forests. © Copyright © 2021 Gizzi, Monteiro, Silva, Schäfer, Castro, Almeida, Chebaane, Bernal-Ibáñez, Henriques, Gestoso and Canning-Clode.

AB  - Large-scale dieback of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is posing an immense threat to forest health in Europe, requiring effective monitoring at large scales. In this study, a pipeline was created to find ash trees and classify dieback severity using high-resolution hyperspectral imagery of individual tree crowns (ITCs). Hyperspectral data were collected in four forest sites near Cambridge, UK, where 422 ITCs were manually delineated and labelled using field-measurements of species and dieback severity (for ash trees). Four algorithms, namely linear discriminant analysis (LDA), principal components analysis coupled with LDA (PCA-LDA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and random forest (RF), were used to build classification models for species and dieback severity classification. The effect of dark-pixel filtering on classification accuracy was evaluated. The best performing models were then coupled with automatic ITC segmentation to map species and ash dieback distribution over 16.8 hectares of woodland. We calculated and partitioned the coefficient of variation (CV) of the reflected ash spectra to find variable wavebands associated with dieback. PLS-DA and LDA were most accurate for classifying ITC species identifies (overall accuracy >90%), whereas RF was most accurate for classifying ash dieback severity (overall accuracy 77%). Dark pixel filtering further increased the accuracy of species classification (+6%), but not disease classification. The reflectances of narrow blue (415 nm), red-edge (680 nm) and NIR (760 nm) bands had high CV across disease classes and should be included if multispectral imagery were to be used to monitor ash dieback. The study demonstrates the possibility of using remote sensing to forward epidemiological research by monitoring forest pathogens in landscape scales, which would allow temperate forest managers to control pathogen outbreaks, assess associated impacts and restore affected forests much more effectively. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In view of the prevailing preferences for health and recreation revealed by previous studies as the main expected benefits of forest visits, the research presented herein focuses on whether such expectations would translate into a significant increase in the number of forest visits (NFV) following pandemic outbreaks. In this context, a Slovak nationwide survey on forests was conducted, with the main objective of casting light on possible changes in NFV as a coping mechanism or behavioral response to the discomfort and severe restrictions stemming from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related measures. The survey was administered on a statistically representative sample after the pandemic’s first wave ebbed and restrictions were eased in the summer months of 2020. Collected data were assessed using ANOVA, the results of which supported the importance of forests as places providing opportunities for restoration of mental and physical resources. Forest accessibility as represented by forest coverage and settlement size emerged as a paramount factor affecting NFV rates both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and its accompanying measures affected the relationships between NFV and average per capita income, type of employment, and most importantly age, highlighting possible vulnerabilities and disadvantages in certain population segments. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Caries is one of the most prevalent, preventable conditions worldwide. A wide variety of management options are available at different thresholds of disease, ranging from non-operative preventive strategies such as improved oral hygiene, reduced sugar diet, and application of topical fluoride, to minimally invasive treatments for early lesions which are limited to enamel, through to selective removal and restoration for extensive lesions. The cornerstone of caries detection is a visual and tactile dental examination, however, an increasing array of methods of caries lesion detection have been proposed that could potentially support traditional methods of detection and diagnosis. Earlier identification of disease could afford patients the opportunity of less invasive treatment with less destruction of tooth tissue, reduce the need for treatment with aerosol-generating procedures, and potentially result in a reduced cost of care to the patient and to healthcare services. Objectives: Our primary objective was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of different electrical conductance devices for the detection and diagnosis of non-cavitated coronal dental caries in different populations (children, adolescents, and adults) and when tested against different reference standards. Search methods: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist undertook a search of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 26 April 2019); Embase Ovid (1980 to 26 April 2019); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 26 April 2019); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 26 April 2019). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. Selection criteria: We included diagnostic accuracy studies that compared electrical conductance devices with a reference standard of histology or an enhanced visual examination. This included prospective studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of single index tests and studies that directly compared two or more index tests. We included studies using previously extracted teeth or those that recruited participants with teeth believed to be sound or with early lesions limited to enamel. Studies that explicitly recruited participants with more advanced lesions that were obviously into dentine or frankly cavitated were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors extracted data independently using a piloted study data extraction form based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for each study. This information was displayed as coupled forest plots, and plotted as summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) plots, displaying the sensitivity-specificity points for each study. Due to variability in thresholds we estimated diagnostic accuracy using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) methods. Main results: We included seven studies reporting a total of 719 tooth sites or surfaces, with an overall prevalence of the target condition of 73% (528 tooth sites or surfaces). The included studies evaluated two index tests: the electronic caries monitor (ECM) (four studies, 475 tooth surfaces) and CarieScan Pro (three studies, 244 tooth surfaces). Six studies used histology as the reference standard, one used an enhanced visual examination. No study was considered to be at low risk of bias across all four domains or low concern for applicability or both. All studies were at high (five studies) or unclear (two studies) risk of bias for the patient selection domain. We judged two studies to be at unclear risk of bias for the index test domain, and one study to be at high risk of bias for the reference standard and flow and timing domains. We judged three studies to be at low concern for applicability for patient selection, and all seven studies to be of low concern for reference standard and flow and timing domains. Studies were synthesised using a hierarchical method for meta-analysis. There was variability in the results of the individual studies, with sensitivities which ranged from 0.55 to 0.98 and specificities from 0 to 1.00. These extreme values of specificity may be explained by a low number of healthy tooth surfaces in the included samples. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 15.65 (95% CI 1.43 to 171.15), and indicative of the variability in the included studies. Through meta-regression we observed no meaningful difference in accuracy according to device type or dentition. Due to the small number of studies we were unable to formally investigate other potential sources of heterogeneity. We judged the certainty of the evidence as very low, and downgraded for risk of bias due to limitations in the design and conduct of the included studies, imprecision arising from the relatively small number of surfaces studied, and inconsistency due to the variability of results. Authors' conclusions: The design and conduct of studies to determine the diagnostic accuracy of methods to detect and diagnose caries in situ is particularly challenging. The evidence base to support the detection and diagnosis of caries with electrical conductance devices is sparse. Newer electrical conductance devices show promise and further research at the enamel caries threshold using a robust study design to minimise bias is warranted. In terms of applicability, any future studies should be carried out in a clinical setting to provide a realistic assessment within the oral cavity where plaque, staining, and restorations can be problematic.

AB  - Butternut is a relatively uncommon hardwood tree native to eastern North America. The species' abundance has declined over the past 50 years, primarily because of an invasive pathogen (Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum [Oc-j]) and loss of suitable habitat for regeneration. Although genetic diversity of butternut is highest along the southern range edge, genetic diversity rangewide is fairly high, except in small and isolated populations. Although there is little evidence for even moderate resistance in native butternut, hybrids with Japanese walnut, a closely related species, display enough tolerance to infection to persist on the landscape and bear abundant nut crops year after year. Cryostorage of native embryogenic axes has yielded promising initial results as a strategy for gene conservation, but additional action is needed to conserve the remaining native gene pool. We describe a strategy for canker-resistance breeding in butternut using naturally occurring hybrids, hybrids in research orchards, and sources of native trees from as many regions as possible. Forest managers are encouraged to find surviving trees and collect seed for planting in suitable habitat to develop actionable knowledge that will enable the restoration of butternut with enough resistance to be self-sustaining on the landscape. © 2020 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of American Foresters.

AB  - Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a potential predictive surrogate marker for disease monitoring. Due to the sparse knowledge about their phenotype and its changes during cancer progression and treatment response, CTC isolation remains challenging. Here we focused on the mechanical characterization of circulating non‐hematopoietic cells from breast cancer patients to evaluate its utility for CTC detection. For proof of premise, we used healthy peripheral blood mononu-clear cells (PBMCs), human MDA‐MB 231 breast cancer cells and human HL‐60 leukemia cells to create a CTC model system. For translational experiments CD45 negative cells—possible CTCs— were isolated from blood samples of patients with mamma carcinoma. Cells were mechanically characterized in the optical stretcher (OS). Active and passive cell mechanical data were related with physiological descriptors by a random forest (RF) classifier to identify cell type specific prop-erties. Cancer cells were well distinguishable from PBMC in cell line tests. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that in PBMC the elliptic deformation was significantly increased compared to non-hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, non‐hematopoietic cells showed significantly higher shape resto-ration. Based on Kelvin–Voigt modeling, the RF algorithm revealed that elliptic deformation and shape restoration were crucial parameters and that the OS discriminated non‐hematopoietic cells from PBMC with an accuracy of 0.69, a sensitivity of 0.74, and specificity of 0.63. The CD45 negative cell population in the blood of breast cancer patients is mechanically distinguishable from healthy PBMC. Together with cell morphology, the mechanical fingerprint might be an appropriate tool for marker‐free CTC detection. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The reintroduction of disease-resistant hybrids is a commonly proposed solution to the introduction of pathogens and pests that weaken or eliminate native plant species. Plant interactions with soil biota result in plant–soil feedbacks (PSFs), which have consequences for individual plant growth and survival as well as broader community-level processes, such as species diversity and coexistence. Because of their importance, species reintroduction should consider these interactions, yet little work has integrated this perspective. Here, we investigate the effects of hybrid Castanea (chestnut) reintroduction on PSFs and how these mechanisms may influence the recruitment of other species in contemporary forests. We also examine how blight-resistant Castanea hybrids perform in the soil conditions of contemporary forests and we compare their belowground interactions with those of Castanea dentata. We conducted a reciprocal greenhouse experiment testing the effect of species-specific soil inoculum on the growth and survival of C. dentata, Castanea hybrids, and other forest dominants. Our results suggest that C. dentata and hybrids had similar belowground interactions and were regulated by negative PSFs, meaning soil microbial communities reduced conspecific growth and survival. These negative PSFs may involve the presence of the non-native pathogen Phytophthera cinnamomi. Soil inoculum of C. dentata and Castanea hybrids had similar effects on heterospecific growth, suggesting Castanea restoration will have neutral effects on natural regeneration in restoration plantings. We conclude that Castanea hybrids may fill a similar belowground niche to their parent species, and that site selection, screening for soil pathogens, and site planting density will be important to restoration. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - The way the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted human lives and livelihoods constituted a stress test for agroecosystems in developing countries, as part of rural-urban systems and the global economy. We applied two conceptual schemes to dissect the evidence in peer-reviewed literature so far, as a basis for better understanding and enabling ‘building back better’. Reported positive impacts of the lockdown ‘anthropause’ on environmental conditions were likely only short-term, while progress towards sustainable development goals was more consistently set back especially for social aspects such as livelihood, employment, and income. The loss of interconnectedness, driving loss of assets, followed a ‘collapse’ cascade that included urban-to-rural migration due to loss of urban jobs, and illegal exploitation of forests and wildlife. Agricultural activities geared to international trade were generally disrupted, while more local markets flourished. Improved understanding of these pathways is needed for synergy between the emerging adaptive, mitigative, transformative, and reimaginative responses. Dominant efficiency-seeking strategies that increase fragility will have to be re-evaluated to be better prepared for further pandemics, that current Human-Nature interactions are likely to trigger. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Severe tree decline in natural ecosystems around the world has driven Phytophthora research, resulting in a better understanding of the diversity and association of Phytophthora species with different host plants. Improved molecular techniques have contributed significantly to that understanding. The devastating impact of Phytophthora dieback in native vegetation in the southwest of Western Australia (SWWA) has motivated a committed research effort to understand the survival and spread of this pathogen. Hot, dry summers characterise the climate of this ecosystem, and are supposedly unfavourable for a moisture-loving pathogen to survive, spread and thrive. However, Phytophthora cinnamomi can survive within the roots of native plant species allowing for its persistence. Random plant sampling, with metabarcoding from root samples, revealed the presence of at least 23 Phytophthora species on 18 of the 20 plant species growing on mining stockpiles of the Huntly mine site (Alcoa of Australia Limited) in SWWA. Phytophthora cinnamomi was detected on 16 of the 20 plant species. This finding supports the idea that native plant species have a significant role in the survival and spread of P. cinnamomi in the environment. The presence of other Phytophthora species challenges the assumption that P. cinnamomi is the main cause of Phytophthora dieback; the disease may be complex, involving several Phytophthora species. These unexpected detections indicate that plants in the natural forest can serve as the reservoir of inoculum of not only P. cinnamomi but also for other Phytophthora species. © 2021, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.

AB  - Regenerating longleaf pine is essential for the long-term sustainability of longleaf pine forest ecosystems and the important services those forests provide, particularly for endangered organisms. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence, density, and distribution of longleaf regeneration across a range of site quality, forest type, and disturbance regimes within the longleaf pine range from 1995 to 2019. We used 6,128 plots from multiple inventory cycles of the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) dataset covering the entire longleaf pine range. The methods of analysis included logistic regression and the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. Two sets of measurements of 2,092 plots were used for change detection analysis. Longleaf regeneration was abundant in longleaf and loblolly pine-dominated stands. For a one-unit increase in the basal area ratio of longleaf pine trees in the plots, the probability of occurrence of longleaf pine seedlings and saplings increased up to 239% and 362%, respectively. The density and occurrence of longleaf regeneration were significantly greater on low-quality sites than on high-quality sites. Longleaf seedlings occurred with less frequency on disturbed sites, particularly by insects, diseases, and animals, than on undisturbed sites. Similarly, longleaf saplings were found with less frequency on sites disturbed by harvesting, weather, insects, diseases, and animals. We found a declining geographic range of longleaf pine trees, saplings, and seedlings during the 1995–2019 period. The density and ratio of longleaf seedlings decreased in about 25.2% and 14.0%, and increased in around 13.5% and 6.2% of the study area, respectively. Likewise, the density and ratio of longleaf saplings decreased in nearly 36.1% and 24.8% and increased in approximately 14.4% and 11.5% of the study area, respectively. Understanding the regeneration dynamics of longleaf pine is essential to restore and effectively regenerate longleaf pine forest ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For over 40 years, biotechnology and genetic engineering (GE) have been used in the development of medicines and biologic agents important in protecting and augmenting human health and have been met with broad public acceptance in the health care arena. GE has also been used to improve and develop plants important to agriculture and forestry, but in these areas, it has often encountered intense opposition that has prevented or delayed the introduction of potentially useful plants. Much of the opposition to GE's application in agriculture and forestry may be driven by concerns that GE plants will serve primarily to encourage the domination of the food and wood products industries by monopolistic corporations or will be disruptive to the environment. But to conflate genetic modifications intended to promote healthy ecosystems or preserve threatened species with GE projects aimed at benefiting corporate agriculture and forestry is misleading and illogical. Further, the pervasive human disruption and damage to forest ecosystems makes it prudent to bring the best that science can offer to the protection and restoration of critical woodland denizens and broader ecosystem health. The notion that minimal human intervention in the forest environment may be the best approach ignores humanity's responsibility to help manage and protect some of the very places that have been most damaged by human intrusion. GE intended to improve forest health should be afforded the same consideration, acceptance, and support as GE intended to improve human health. These efforts should include the use of GE technology such as carefully developed transgenic trees to cure ongoing forest pathogenesis, such as the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica), which threatens to drive the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) to extinction. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology

AB  - Background: Caries is one of the most prevalent and preventable conditions worldwide. If identified early enough then non-invasive techniques can be applied, and therefore this review focusses on early caries involving the enamel surface of the tooth. The cornerstone of caries detection and diagnosis is a visual and tactile dental examination, although alternative approaches are available. These include illumination-based devices that could potentially support the dental examination. There are three categories of illumination devices that exploit various methods of application and interpretation, each primarily defined by different wavelengths, optical coherence tomography (OCT), near-infrared (NIR), and fibre-optic technology, which incorporates more recently developed digital fibre optics (FOTI/DIFOTI). Objectives: To estimate the diagnostic test accuracy of different illumination tests for the detection and diagnosis of enamel caries in children or adults. We also planned to explore the following potential sources of heterogeneity: in vitro or in vivo studies with different reference standards; tooth surface (occlusal, proximal, smooth surface, or adjacent to a restoration); single or multiple sites of assessment on a tooth surface; and the prevalence of caries into dentine. Search methods: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist undertook a search of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 15 February 2019); Embase Ovid (1980 to 15 February 2019); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 15 February 2019); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 15 February 2019). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. Selection criteria: We included diagnostic accuracy study designs that compared the use of illumination-based devices with a reference standard (histology, enhanced visual examination with or without radiographs, or operative excavation). These included prospective studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a single index test and studies that directly compared two or more index tests. Both in vitro and in vivo studies of primary and permanent teeth were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies that explicitly recruited participants with caries into dentine or frank cavitation. We also excluded studies that artificially created carious lesions and those that used an index test during the excavation of dental caries to ascertain the optimum depth of excavation. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors extracted data independently and in duplicate using a standardised data extraction form and quality assessment based on QUADAS-2 specific to the clinical context. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined using the bivariate hierarchical method to produce summary points of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence regions. The comparative accuracy of different illumination devices was conducted based on indirect and direct comparisons between methods. Potential sources of heterogeneity were pre-specified and explored visually and more formally through meta-regression. Main results: We included 24 datasets from 23 studies that evaluated 16,702 tooth surfaces. NIR was evaluated in 6 datasets (673 tooth surfaces), OCT in 10 datasets (1171 tooth surfaces), and FOTI/DIFOTI in 8 datasets (14,858 tooth surfaces). The participant selection domain had the largest number of studies judged at high risk of bias (16 studies). Conversely, for the index test, reference standard, and flow and timing domains the majority of studies were judged to be at low risk of bias (16, 12, and 16 studies respectively). Concerns regarding the applicability of the evidence were judged as high or unclear for all domains. Notably, 14 studies were judged to be of high concern for participant selection, due to selective participant recruitment, a lack of independent examiners, and the use of an in vitro study design. The summary estimate across all the included illumination devices was sensitivity 0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.85) and specificity 0.87 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.92), with a diagnostic odds ratio of 21.52 (95% CI 10.89 to 42.48). In a cohort of 1000 tooth surfaces with a prevalence of enamel caries of 57%, this would result in 142 tooth surfaces being classified as disease free when enamel caries was truly present (false negatives), and 56 tooth surfaces being classified as diseased in the absence of enamel caries (false positives). A formal comparison of the accuracy according to device type indicated a difference in sensitivity and/or specificity (Chi2(4) = 34.17, P &lt; 0.01). Further analysis indicated a difference in the sensitivity of the different devices (Chi2(2) = 31.24, P &lt; 0.01) with a higher sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.97) for OCT compared to NIR 0.58 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.68) and FOTI/DIFOTI 0.47 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.59), but no meaningful difference in specificity (Chi2(2) = 3.47, P = 0.18). In light of these results, we planned to formally assess potential sources of heterogeneity according to device type, but due to the limited number of studies for each device type we were unable to do so. For interpretation, we presented the coupled forest plots for each device type according to the potential source of heterogeneity. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low and downgraded two levels in total due to avoidable and unavoidable study limitations in the design and conduct of studies, indirectness arising from the in vitro studies, and imprecision of the estimates. Authors' conclusions: Of the devices evaluated, OCT appears to show the most potential, with superior sensitivity to NIR and fibre-optic devices. Its benefit lies as an add-on tool to support the conventional oral examination to confirm borderline cases in cases of clinical uncertainty. OCT is not currently available to the general dental practitioner, and so further research and development are necessary. FOTI and NIR are more readily available and easy to use; however, they show limitations in their ability to detect enamel caries but may be considered successful in the identification of sound teeth. Future studies should strive to avoid research waste by ensuring that recruitment is conducted in such a way as to minimise selection bias and that studies are clearly and comprehensively reported. In terms of applicability, any future studies should be undertaken in a clinical setting that is reflective of the complexities encountered in caries assessment within the oral cavity.

AB  - Tropical areas are located between the Tropic of Cancer where the sun can directly shine, while subtropical areas are roughly between 40° North and South and the Tropic of Cancer (23° 26 min North and South). The tropical and subtropical regions have rich natural resources while undergoing rapid urbanization. Thus, the ecology and environment in these regions are facing unprecedented challenges. Meanwhile, a large number of natural disasters (e.g., typhoons, droughts, and earthquakes) occur in tropical and subtropical regions, and they threaten the sustainable development of human society and the economy in these areas. The application of remote sensing technologies to comprehensively monitor the tropical and subtropical regions is important to the sustainable development of these areas and even the world. However, remote sensing monitoring needs to overcome special challenges due to the complex geographic conditions of tropical and subtropical regions (e.g., cloudy and rainy throughout the year). This review analyzed 7594 research papers from the Web of Science Core Database and summarizes the state of the art of tropical and subtropical remote sensing, including the demand, status, challenges, and opportunities of tropical and subtropical remote sensing. The techniques of co-citation analysis and term frequency analysis were applied by investigating the clustering characteristics and patterns of the 7594 papers through their lists of references and the frequent terms in the title, abstracts, and keywords. A co-citation relationship network and a term frequency network were established to identify the clusters of research by unsupervised machine learning methods. A total of 22 co-citation clusters and 6 subject clusters were identified. Through an in-depth analysis of these categories, this study summarized (1) the major application topics of tropical and subtropical remote sensing, including urban land surface, tropical rain forest, mangrove, coral, tropical grassland, biodiversity, and natural disasters; and (2) the main remote sensing technologies used in tropical and subtropical regions, including selection of remote sensing data, remote sensing data analysis techniques, solutions to overcome cloud contaminations, and multi-source remote sensing technologies. From the rapid development of modern remote sensing technologies, this study discusses the challenges and future opportunities of tropical and subtropical remote sensing from eight different aspects. (1) Cloud detection, cloud restoration, and sub-pixel unmixing technologies promote the better applications of optical remote sensing in tropical and subtropical areas. (2) Multi-source and -modal fusion technology will bring new opportunities to overcome the problem of cloud contaminations in tropical and subtropical regions with the increasing availability of SAR remote sensing data. (3) Long time-series fusion technology can be used to monitor the tropical and subtropical regions with high temporal resolution and medium-to-high spatial resolution images. (4) New-generation observation satellites from China, Europe, Japan, and United States, as well as aerial remote sensing and UAV platforms, have provided great opportunities. Cloud computing platforms facilitate a long-term comprehensive analysis of full-coverage datasets in tropical and subtropical regions. (5) The in-depth application of tropical and subtropical remote sensing promotes the formation of a more comprehensive interdisciplinary method in Earth system science and sustainable development. © 2021, Science Press.

AB  - Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) is a disease with high human lethality rates, whose transmission risk is directly related to the abundance of reservoir rodents. In the Brazilian Atlantic forest, the main reservoirs species, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Necromys lasiurus, are thought to increase in abundance with deforestation. Therefore, forest restoration may contribute to decrease HCPS transmission risk, a topic still unexplored, especially in tropical regions. Aiming at filling this research gap, we quantified the potential of forest restoration, as required by the current environmental legislation, to reduce the abundance of Hantavirus reservoir rodents in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Using a dataset on small mammal communities sampled at 104 sites, we modeled how the abundance of these two rodent species change with the percentage of forest cover and forest edge density. From the best model, we extrapolated rodent abundance to the entire Atlantic Forest, considering two scenarios: current and restored forest cover. Comparing the estimated abundance between these two scenarios, we show that forest restoration can reduce the abundance of O. nigripes up to 89.29% in 43.43% of Atlantic forest territory. For N. lasiurus, abundance decreased up to 46% in 44% of the Atlantic forest. To our knowledge, this is the first study linking forest restoration and zoonotic diseases. Our results indicate that forest restoration would decrease the chance of HCPS transmission in ~45% of the Atlantic forest, making the landscape healthier to ~2,8 million people living within this area. This positive effect of restoration on disease regulation should be considered as an additional argument to encourage and promote forest restoration in tropical areas around the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Robotic gait training helps the nervous system recover and strengthen weak muscle groups. Many studies in the literature show that applying robotic gait rehabilitation to patients with neurological disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Stroke and Spinal Cord Injection (SCI) effectively restores gait ability. In contrast to the studies in the literature that included only healthy individuals, both the control and patient groups were formed and detailed analyses were carried out for both groups. In this study, EMG signals in GMA, GME, ILP, BF, VM, MG, TA muscles were recorded simultaneously with a different electrode placement during robotic gait for the first time in literature and then a location that prevents a phase shift was presented. The classification performance has also been increased by removing 26 different attribute parameters like time, frequency and statistics from the signals instead of gait studies with a maximum of 12–16 traits extraction. The extracted features were classified with the approaches Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbourhood algorithm (KNN), Random Forest Classification Algorithm (RF) and Deep Learning and then a detailed performance comparison have been realized. Among the approaches compared the Stochastic Gradient Optimization Algorithm-based deep learning structure produced the best performance with 98.5714% accuracy. It was also seen that it is essential to plan the exoskeleton and the robotic gait pattern suitable for patients’ disease state and muscle activation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic driven by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus–2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become the most critical universal health disaster of this century. Millions of people are staying at home obeying lockdown to halt the spread of this novel virus. The spread of the virus has forced people to use the mask, gloves, hand sanitizer, etc. daily, and healthcare workers to use personal protection equipment following the WHO guidelines, resulting in huge amounts of medical waste. This pandemic has led to a slowdown of economic activities significantly, and consequently, stock markets have nosedived beyond speculation. Although the deadly coronavirus has taken away millions of precious lives and the livelihood of many sections of people worldwide, it has brought several positive changes in the world. Furthermore, it has led to a massive restoration of the environment and improved air and water quality. Pandemic showed the resilient nature of the environment, including air and water, when human activities are paused. In addition, we also discussed how this pandemic affects human lifestyle behavior. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Long-lived tree species face a myriad of biotic and abiotic threats over their lifetime, some of the most serious being the presence of non-native diseases or pests capable of killing greater than 95% of trees that are exposed to them. Fortunately, the genetic diversity in many of the affected species also includes some individuals and populations with genetic resistance. Over the last 50 years, applied resistance programs have been undertaken in a range of tree species in the U.S. and resistant parent trees have been selected, tested in seedling inoculation trials and in field trials, selections placed into seed orchards, and the resulting seed used for reforestation and restoration. Both major gene resistance (MGR) and quantitative resistance (QR) have been documented in these resistance programs. However, for each resistance program the question arises whether the resistance will be durable, permitting the species to be used in managed plantations, urban plantings or in native forest restoration over the long-term. Field plantings to-date indicate that in some cases virulence to MGR can arise relatively quickly and QR appears to offer the best opportunity for durability. Ultimately, more time and plantings will be needed to discern if resistance is durable in affected tree species. Changes in climate may alter dynamics that could influence durability of resistance. However, even in the case of virulence to MGR, the pathogen or pest may not spread throughout the range of plantings, and genetic resistance will likely continue to be an invaluable tool for species affected by diseases and pests. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Adherent invasive Escherichia Coli (AIEC) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease (CD) in Western populations. Whether the presence of AIEC is also seen in CD populations of different genetic susceptibility and has negative impact on host microbiota ecology and therapeutics are unclear. AIEC presence was assessed in ileal tissues of 60 Hong Kong Chinese patients with CD and 56 healthy subjects. Mucosa microbiota was analyzed by 16s rRNA sequencing. Impact of AIEC on the gut microbiota was determined in a mouse model. AIEC was significantly more prevalent in ileal tissues of patients with CD than controls (30% vs 7.1%). Presence of AIEC in ileal tissues was associated with more severe mucosa microbiota dysbiosis in CD with decreased diversity and lower abundance of Firmicutes including butyrate producing Roseburia and probiotic Bacillus. A random forest model predicted the presence of AIEC with area under the curve of 0.89. AIEC exacerbated dysbiosis in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice and led to resistance to restoration of normal gut microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Proportion of donor-derived bacteria in AIEC-colonized mice was significantly lower than that in uninfected mice. AIEC was prevalent and associated with severe mucosa microbiota dysbiosis in CD in Hong Kong Chinese population. The presence of AIEC impeded restoration of normal gut microbiota. AIEC may serve as a keystone bacterium in CD and impact the efficacy of FMT. © 2021 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The economic and health crisis caused by COVID-19 calls into question the reconfiguration trajectories of food systems in the Republic of Congo. It questions the extent to which the regulatory measures taken by the public authorities and the adaptation strategies of the actors lead to changes in the structural governance of the country's food system. The article analyses the strategies for adapting to the crisis, by using secondary data and authors' experience of support to public policies in the agricultural and food sector. In Congo, the food sector remains dependent on the outside world and relies on extensive subsistence farming. To manage the pandemic, a general, 'flexible' containment of the population has been applied. Panic buying, reduced market activities and the temporary rise in food prices revealed the fragility of the sector linked to its dependence on international markets. However, the crisis has confirmed the collective innovative capacity of the informal sector. It has restored the recognition of urban agriculture has source of employment for vulnerable populations. It calls into question the design of future agricultural and food policies with regard to the integration of health, food and social risks, in the context of the Congo Forest Basin, which is exposed to the risk of a resurgence of existing zoonoses and emerging diseases. © J.

AB  - The presence of sulfur in the environment is an important macroelement for plant growth but becomes harmful in excessive amounts. The previous century saw rising levels of high SO2 concentrations (stemming from fossil fuel combustion) and wet deposition from acid rain, causing the intensification of forest die-back. Air pollution can be controlled or measured by biomonitoring. Despite recent reductions in SO2 emissions, urban and industrial areas are still at risk from high sulfur contamination. Open-cast lignite and sulfur borehole mining play a pivotal role in the regional scale of ecosystem contamination and acid mine drainage. Consequently, these aspects are unique for assessing the impact of extreme S contamination on soil properties changes, the vegetation effect, and biogeochemical cycles. We presented i) current SO2 pollution based on S concentration in pine needles, and ii) a comprehensive study of soil properties, as well as plant reactions to excessive sulfur concentration in the restored forest ecosystem of a former sulfur mine. © 2021 Likus-Cieślik and Pietrzykowski.

AB  - This chapter deals with wildfires in Paraguay and their environmental and human impacts. Wildfires are a significant threat, both for the loss of forest area and the resulting environmental, recreational and productive services, as well as for damage to public health and property. Wildfires are a cyclical and recurring risk, increasing in intensity from July to October. The number of fire sources, from 2005 to 2020, in the Western or Chaco region, totalised 1,221,445, and in the Eastern Region 471,448. Although the National Emergency Secretariat reported in October 2019 that the wildfires affected 325,000 in the Chaco or Western Region and 10,929 wildfire foci existed in the humid Eastern Region, recent estimates based on NPP-Suomi satellite data suggest a total closer to one million ha. The Ministry of Health assisted more than 1,500 people for respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis. Wildfires can lead to the proliferation of vector-borne diseases, loss of biodiversity and climate modification. Analysis of exposure and vulnerability elements of wildfires (e.g. occurrence and climate scenarios), will allow for management options (e.g. education, early warning, climate-based decision-support systems, equipping and training firefighters, prescribed burning, and ecosystem restoration) © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Dutch elm disease (DED) is a vascular wilt disease caused by the pathogens Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi with multiple ecological phases including pathogenic (xylem), saprotrophic (bark) and vector (beetle flight and beetle feeding wound) phases. Due to the two DED pandemics during the twentieth century the use of elms in landscape and forest restoration has declined significantly. However new initiatives for elm breeding and restoration are now underway in Europe and North America. Here we discuss complexities in the DED ‘system’ that can lead to unintended consequences during elm breeding and some of the wider options for obtaining durability or ‘field resistance’ in released material, including (1) the phenotypic plasticity of disease levels in resistant cultivars infected by O. novo-ulmi; (2) shortcomings in test methods when selecting for resistance; (3) the implications of rapid evolutionary changes in current O. novo-ulmi populations for the choice of pathogen inoculum when screening; (4) the possibility of using active resistance to the pathogen in the beetle feeding wound, and low attractiveness of elm cultivars to feeding beetles, in addition to resistance in the xylem; (5) the risk that genes from susceptible and exotic elms be introgressed into resistant cultivars; (6) risks posed by unintentional changes in the host microbiome; and (7) the biosecurity risks posed by resistant elm deployment. In addition, attention needs to be paid to the disease pressures within which resistant elms will be released. In the future, biotechnology may further enhance our understanding of the various resistance processes in elms and our potential to deploy trees with highly durable resistance in elm restoration. Hopefully the different elm resistance processes will prove to be largely under durable, additive, multigenic control. Elm breeding programmes cannot afford to get into the host–pathogen arms races that characterise some agricultural host–pathogen systems. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - At present, although large-scale forest land has been restored and exploited in China through a large number of artificial afforestation, the tree species of the plantation are simple and the structure law, it has caused many ecosystem problems such as pests and diseases, soil fertility decline, etc. Therefore, ensuring the sustainable development of forests through near-natural management is of great significance. Near-natural forest stands can effectively resist natural disasters and pests, optimize soil physical and chemical properties, increase biodiversity, and improve the ecological and economic benefits of forests. Through the evaluation of near-naturalness, we can understand the actual growth status of the stand and construct a near-natural evaluation system that conforms to the conditions of the local site conditions, thus providing a reliable basis for near-natural management. According to the natural conditions of five typical plantation forests in the eastern part of Qinghai province, this paper aims at the near-natural management of plantation ecological public forests and tries to put forward the stand structure adjustment strategies and methods. The vertical structure, horizontal structure, herb coverage and its diversity, natural regeneration, species diversity, composition coefficient, diameter distribution, ratio of dead wood, and healthy wood are mainly selected from the aspects of stand structure, species composition, age and dead wood. Based on the combination of qualitative description and quantitative analysis, the near-natural unit circle 7T-value rule was applied to evaluate the natural characteristics of five typical forest stands and propose corresponding reform measures based on the evaluation results. Picea crass if alia - Bet u la pla typhylla mixed forest ( coPB =0.4786) is a far from nature forest. Such forests do not need too much artificial rearing under reasonable density. Papains cathayana-Betula platyphylla mixed forest ( (oRP =0.2664) is near plantation forest. In this kind of stand, the main activities are to cut down the Papains cathayana infested with insect pests, adjust the density and replant Picea crassifalia. Picea crassifolia-Populns cathayana mixed forest ( copp =0.2283) is near plantation forest. This kind of stand is mainly to cut off the Populus cathayana with serious disease and insect pest, adjust the density, and replant Betula platyphylla. Picea crassifalia-Larix principis- rupprechtii mixed forest ( copi =0.1872) is plantation forest. This type of stand is mainly to adjust density and replant Betula platyphylla. Picea crassifalia forest ( cop =0.0190) is plantation forest. This type of stand is mainly for adjusting density and constructing Picea crassifalia -Betula platyphylla mixed forests. Through the evaluation and analysis of the near-natural condition, it provides a direct and reliable basis for local near-natural management. The method to adjust the stand structure is to first adjust the stand density by removing disturbing trees, and then create a mixed forest of coniferous and broad- leaved trees, among which Picea crassifolia-Betula platyphylla mixed forest is the main one. © 2021 Science Press.

AB  - Translocating plants to natural habitats is a long-standing conservation practice but is growing in magnitude to deliver international targets to mitigate climate change and reverse biodiversity loss. Concurrently, outbreaks of novel plant pests and pathogens are multiplying with increased global trade network connectivity and larger volumes of imported plants, raising concerns that restoration plantings may act as introductory disease pathways. We used UK common juniper, subject since ~1995 to conservation plantings and now experiencing significant mortality from the non-native pathogen Phytophthora austrocedri Gresl. & E. M. Hansen, as an example species to explore the availability of monitoring data that could be used to assess disease risks posed by planting. We compiled spatial records of juniper planting including qualitative data on sources of planting material, propagation settings and organization types that managed planting projects. We found that juniper planting activity expanded every decade since 1990 across the UK and while not all planting resulted in outbreaks, 19% of P. austrocedri detections were found within 2 km of a known planting. We highlight the scale and diversity of organizations raising and planting juniper, as well as the lack of source material traceability, and suggest that cross-sector collaboration and changes in practice are required to reduce the risks of pathogen introduction posed by restoration planting. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Modern forestry is gradually moving towards man-made forests on a large scale. Plantations with advanced forestry system have been introduced with the goal of sustainable forestry development and to enhance social, ecological, and economic benefits. Forest plantations with native and exotic species have been established in China and worldwide with shorter rotation cycles than natural forests. In this paper, we discuss the role and perspectives of plantation forests in the Chinese sustainable forest development, the evolution of various plantation programs, the ecological effects of plantations, and the measures to improve plantation forestry. The Chinese government has given substantial importance to nurturing plantation forest resources through various large scale afforestation programs. In 2019, the total area covered by plantations in China reached 79.54 million ha, with a stock volume of 3.39 billion m³ (59.30 m³ per ha); coniferous forests (26.11 million ha, 32.83%) and broad-leaved forests (26.45 million ha, 33.25%) are the dominant types. Plantations have been pri-marily distributed in the central and southern parts of the country. Plantations with fast-growing and high-yielding tree species facilitated Chinese afforestation activities and improved the administration of forest production, which ef-fectively boosted the forest industry. Plantation forest resources offer many potential productive, economic, and social advantages, though they are also associated with a loss of biodiversity and climate change makes them likely susceptible to disease and insect attack. Appropriate forest management practices during planning, execution, and maintenance of plantations can contribute to the conservation, promotion, and restoration of biodiversity, with the final aim of attaining a balance between having forest plantations and natural forests. © SISEF.

AB  - Over the past two decades, more than half a million acres of forested land has experienced extensive insect- and disease-caused tree mortality within the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Region 2 (R2) of the National Forest System. To plan for timber harvest treatments needed to restore forest health, managers need information on forest product facility capacity and capability to profitably process timber of various size classes. To answer this need, the authors summarized timber harvest volumes by state and county group, identified facilities in the R2 area, quantified timber-processing capacities and size class capabilities, and analyzed the geographic variability of timber flows from county of harvest to mill. Results showed that nearly 285.5 million board feet Scribner of timber flowed from the study area to 101 processors throughout the R2 timber-processing area. Approximately 70 percent of annual milling capacity can profitably process trees ≧10 in. dbh, whereas just 8 percent can process timber <7 in. dbh. When planning forestmanagement activities, land managers should balance the need to remove small and/or dead trees with the local industry’s ability to profitably use that material. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Assisted migration of forest tree populations through reforestation and restoration is a climate change adaptation strategy under consideration in many jurisdictions. Matching climates in which seed sources evolved with near future climates projected for plantation sites should help reduce maladaptation and increase plantation health and productivity. For threatened tree species, assisted migration outside of the species range could help avert extinction. Here, we examine lessons, limitations, and challenges of assisted migration through the lens of three assisted migration field trials of conifers in Canada and Mexico: Pinus albicaulis Engelm., an endangered subalpine tree species in the mountains of western North America; the Picea glauca (Moench) Voss × P. engelmannii Parry ex Engelm hybrid complex, of great economic and ecological importance in western Canada, and Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. &amp; Cham., a tree species that provides overwintering sites for the monarch butterfly. We conclude that: (a) negative impacts of climate change on productivity of Picea glauca × P. engelmannii may be mitigated by planting seed sources from locations that are 3◦C mean coldest month temperature warmer than the plantation; (b) it is possible to establish Pinus albicaulis outside of its current natural distribution at sites that have climates that are within the species’ modelled historic climatic niche, although developing disease-resistant trees through selective breeding is a higher priority in the short term; (c) Abies religiosa performs well when moved 400 m upward in elevation and local shrubs (such as Baccharis conferta Kunth) are used as nurse plants; (d) new assisted migration field trials that contain populations from a wide range of climates tested in multiple disparate climates are needed, despite the costs; and (e) where naturalization of a migrated tree species in recipient ecosystem is viewed as undesirable, the invasive potential of the tree species should be assessed prior to large scale establishment, and stands should be monitored regularly following establishment. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Natural sounds are known to contribute to health and well‐being. However, few studies have investigated what makes a natural sound renew and re‐energize people, especially in the face of significant stressors caused by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19). This study examined the interactive mechanism towards the perceived restorative characteristics of natural soundscapes: fascination, being‐away, compatibility, and extent. Two groups of data were collected in Burleigh Heads National Park, Australia, before the outbreak of COVID‐19 (n = 526) and in October 2020 (n = 371). The objective measures of LAeq confirmed that the acoustic environment of Burleigh Heads National Park are quiet and peaceful for attention restoration. The results of the subject evaluation revealed that participants from the post‐COVID‐19 group reported higher stress levels, while there was a greater mental restoration through water sounds. There are significant differences between the pre‐ and post‐COVID‐19 groups with respect to the relationships among the perceived restorative characteristics of natural soundscapes. The direct effects of extent and fascination, as well as the mediating effects of fascination, were more significant among the post‐COVID‐19 group than the pre‐COVID‐19 group. However, the effects of being‐away on compatibility were less significant in the post‐COVID‐19 group. This study reduces the gap that exists on the research of environment–people–health–wellbeing nexus. Knowledge about natural soundscapes encourages administrations to consider it as a guideline for the planning and management of natural resources, especially during the COVID‐19 pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - With the increased risk of extinction of woody species, there is a great need for botanical gardens for the ex situ conservation of threatened woody species in devoted conservation collections. The box tree (Buxus hyrcana Pojark.) is an endemic and endangered species of Hyrcanian forests, northern Iran. In recent years, many individuals of this species have been dried in a considerable range of Hyrcanian forests due to box blight disease and box-tree moth. Since the construction of the National Botanical Garden of Iran (NBGI) in 1967, B. hyrcana seedlings have been gathered from Hyrcanian forests and planted in the Hyrcanian habitat of the garden, so that the healthy individuals of B. hyrcana in the garden today have a good natural reproduction. In this study, we studied the successful experience of the NBGI as the only reliable source of healthy B. hyrcana seedlings to restore the destroyed habitats of B. hyrcana in Hyrcanian forests. This study emphasizes on two main issues: the foresight of garden staff in ex situ conservation of endangered species and the important role of NBGI in this conservation. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The root of Codonopis bulleynana Forest ex Diels (cbFeD), a tonic food widely used in Yunnan Province of China, was found to have a wide range of pharmacological effects. The present study was designed to investigate the anti-fibrotic effect of water extracts of cbFeD in chronic liver injury mice model induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and to explore its underlying mechanisms. Phytochemical analysis revealed multiple components were present in the water extract of cbFeD and the compounds were mostly enriched in organic acid and its derivatives, flavone, amino acid derivatives, nucleotide and its derivatives, carbohydrates etc. Treatment with cbFeD significantly attenuated liver injury and fibrosis in CCl4-administered mice evidenced by improved liver histology, ameliorated apoptosis of hepatocytes, and decreased transaminase levels in the serum. Decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were markedly reversed upon treatment with cbFeD while levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) were significantly restored towards normal values. cbFeD also suppressed intrahepatic inflammatory cell infiltration and Kupffer cell activation. Furthermore, our study revealed an inhibitory effect of cbFeD on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, cbFeD could exert a protective role against liver fibrosis in mice model induced by CCl4 that is comparable to the positive control silymarin and might be developed into a promising anti-fibrotic drug. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - There is currently no consensual definition of deforestation. Given its importance in several research topics ranging from biodiversity to climate change, conservation, restoration, and emerging diseases as well as in comparative studies, it is necessary to provide an integrated framework towards a harmonized definition of deforestation. Here, we analyze and compare international and national reports on deforestation management (e.g., FAO, UNFCCC) and find important differences, including contrasting definitions of deforestation and conceptual ambiguities. We also present a straightforward, harmonized definition of deforestation that is linked to a specific methodology for decision-making studies. This proposal can contribute to informed decision-making on studies related to deforestation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Change is ubiquitous in forest ecosystems. Forests undergo both seasonality ns well as enduring escalation cycles which may vary in long term. These long-term changes are punctuated by habitually interim disturbances from fire, insects, disease, and harvest which strongly alter the state and functioning of the forest. The spatio-temporal information on process-based forest loss as well as change is essential for a wide range of applications. The disturbances over forest cover and resulted changes alter the water and carbon cycles of forest stands as well as bang the habitat and biodiversity of these ecosystems. To effectively understand how forest disturbance impacts forest state and functioning, the disturbance and related effects on forest cover is needed to be quantified at spatial scale where human management and natural strife occur. In this present study, the spatial pattern of forest cover of the four blocks like Garhbeta 1, Garhbeta 2, Garhbeta 3 and Salboni under Midnapore Sadar Sub-division was analysed on temporal scale. The forested area of this region is region is lying under the Midnapore forest division, the total area of which is 50,267.49 ha. Forest is the one of the important natural resources of this area and the important source of rural livelihood as well as ecological sustainability. But it is changing temporally rather is fading and maximum stress is seen onto the dense forest and open forest. So for the restoration practice, forest disturbance indexing as well as identification of disturbed sites and an account on forest regeneration and degeneration are so needful. Therefore, as per the goal of the study a Multicriteria based Forest Disturbance Index and forest fragmentation analysis were deployed. Finally it is so pertinent to mention that the forest covers under the blocks like Garhbeta 2 and Salboni were in a miserable state. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The global spread of invasive plant pathogens is increasing, putting natural forests and ecosystem services under threat. Spatial data can quantify range non-overlap between invasive pathogens and their hosts to identify existing and potentially restorable refugia to enable ‘escape’ from the pathogen. In 2017, myrtle rust Austropuccinia psidii was detected in New Zealand. New Zealand has 27 native woody and liana species in the plant family susceptible to the disease (Myrtaceae), many of which are ecosystem dominants and economically important. Spatial methods were used to compare the current New Zealand distribution of myrtle rust with the modelled distributions of its potential native hosts. To guide management and set priorities for conservation of at-risk species, areas of potential refugia where a Myrtaceae species is predicted to occur outside the pathogen range were identified under two myrtle rust distribution scenarios. Myrtle rust will thrive in New Zealand's warmer regions. Many native Myrtaceae are distributed within this area, but several species occur extensively outside the core range of the disease. Species distributed in cooler southern regions will be best placed to persist in refugia. Myrtaceae species with specific habitat requirements and narrow geographical ranges in warmer (northern) areas are likely to require ex situ or active in situ management. Even widely distributed species will benefit from the restoration of suitable habitat that supports multiple species outside the myrtle rust range. Synthesis and applications. Spatial data can be used to identify refugia and restoration opportunities, and thus inform landscape-level management responses to invasive pathogens. This approach can guide decisions over where to implement in situ (e.g. fungicide spraying) versus ex situ (e.g. seed banking, botanic gardens) management efforts. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Ethiopia aims to restore 15 million ha degraded forests and woodlands, but effects on the potentially contrasting goals of long-term carbon storage, biodiversity and sustainable livelihoods are unknown. To quantify the effects of grazing exclusion on vegetation and fire behaviour, we established six 30 × 30 m fenced exclosures with grazed controls, in a mesic wooded savanna. Experimental burns were done after 1.5 years. Tree seedlings were few but more common inside fences. Field layer cover and biomass increased inside fences, and grass species increased in numbers and cover. Fire intensity was higher inside fences, killing shrubs and saplings but not mature trees. Interviews confirmed that overgrazing has resulted in “cool fires”, causing shrub encroachment. High-intensity fires occurred in the 1980s after a zoonotic disease killed most livestock. Short-term increase in carbon storage through fire and grazing exclusion may lead to loss of pasture, and in the long-term increased wildfire risk. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Caries is one of the most prevalent and preventable conditions worldwide. If identified early enough then non-invasive techniques can be applied, and therefore this review focusses on early caries involving the enamel surface of the tooth. The cornerstone of caries detection is a visual and tactile dental examination, however alternative methods of detection are available, and these include fluorescence-based devices. There are three categories of fluorescence-based device each primarily defined by the different wavelengths they exploit; we have labelled these groups as red, blue, and green fluorescence. These devices could support the visual examination for the detection and diagnosis of caries at an early stage of decay. Objectives: Our primary objectives were to estimate the diagnostic test accuracy of fluorescence-based devices for the detection and diagnosis of enamel caries in children or adults. We planned to investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity: tooth surface (occlusal, proximal, smooth surface or adjacent to a restoration); single point measurement devices versus imaging or surface assessment devices; and the prevalence of more severe disease in each study sample, at the level of caries into dentine. Search methods: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist undertook a search of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 30 May 2019); Embase Ovid (1980 to 30 May 2019); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 30 May 2019); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 30 May 2019). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. Selection criteria: We included diagnostic accuracy study designs that compared a fluorescence-based device with a reference standard. This included prospective studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of single index tests and studies that directly compared two or more index tests. Studies that explicitly recruited participants with caries into dentine or frank cavitation were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors extracted data independently using a piloted study data extraction form based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for each study. This information has been displayed as coupled forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) plots, displaying the sensitivity-specificity points for each study. We estimated diagnostic accuracy using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) methods. We reported sensitivities at fixed values of specificity (median 0.78, upper quartile 0.90). Main results: We included a total of 133 studies, 55 did not report data in the 2 x 2 format and could not be included in the meta-analysis. 79 studies which provided 114 datasets and evaluated 21,283 tooth surfaces were included in the meta-analysis. There was a high risk of bias for the participant selection domain. The index test, reference standard, and flow and timing domains all showed a high proportion of studies to be at low risk of bias. Concerns regarding the applicability of the evidence were high or unclear for all domains, the highest proportion being seen in participant selection. Selective participant recruitment, poorly defined diagnostic thresholds, and in vitro studies being non-generalisable to the clinical scenario of a routine dental examination were the main reasons for these findings. The dominance of in vitro studies also means that the information on how the results of these devices are used to support diagnosis, as opposed to pure detection, was extremely limited. There was substantial variability in the results which could not be explained by the different devices or dentition or other sources of heterogeneity that we investigated. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 14.12 (95% CI 11.17 to 17.84). The estimated sensitivity, at a fixed median specificity of 0.78, was 0.70 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.75). In a hypothetical cohort of 1000 tooth sites or surfaces, with a prevalence of enamel caries of 57%, obtained from the included studies, the estimated sensitivity of 0.70 and specificity of 0.78 would result in 171 missed tooth sites or surfaces with enamel caries (false negatives) and 95 incorrectly classed as having early caries (false positives). We used meta-regression to compare the accuracy of the different devices for red fluorescence (84 datasets, 14,514 tooth sites), blue fluorescence (21 datasets, 3429 tooth sites), and green fluorescence (9 datasets, 3340 tooth sites) devices. Initially, we allowed threshold, shape, and accuracy to vary according to device type by including covariates in the model. Allowing consistency of shape, removal of the covariates for accuracy had only a negligible effect (Chi2 = 3.91, degrees of freedom (df) = 2, P = 0.14). Despite the relatively large volume of evidence we rated the certainty of the evidence as low, downgraded two levels in total, for risk of bias due to limitations in the design and conduct of the included studies, indirectness arising from the high number of in vitro studies, and inconsistency due to the substantial variability of results. Authors' conclusions: There is considerable variation in the performance of these fluorescence-based devices that could not be explained by the different wavelengths of the devices assessed, participant, or study characteristics. Blue and green fluorescence-based devices appeared to outperform red fluorescence-based devices but this difference was not supported by the results of a formal statistical comparison. The evidence base was considerable, but we were only able to include 79 studies out of 133 in the meta-analysis as estimates of sensitivity or specificity values or both could not be extracted or derived. In terms of applicability, any future studies should be carried out in a clinical setting, where difficulties of caries assessment within the oral cavity include plaque, staining, and restorations. Other considerations include the potential of fluorescence devices to be used in combination with other technologies and comparative diagnostic accuracy studies.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Koa (Acacia koa A. Gray) is an economically, ecologically, and culturally valuable tree species endemic to Hawaii. A vascular wilt disease caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. koae Gardner (FOXY) induces high rates of mortality in plantings and threatens native koa forests as well. Landowners are reluctant to consider koa for reforestation purposes in many areas due to the risk of mortality caused by FOXY. Producing seeds with genetic resistance to FOXY is vital to successful koa reforestation and restoration. The Hawaii Agriculture Research Center (HARC), with both public and private partners, operates a tree improvement program to develop wilt-resistant koa populations in Hawaii. The population genetics of koa is poorly understood and seed zones are evolving. Thus, HARC uses provisional seed zones based on genetic and biogeographic variables and has selected wilt-resistant koa populations that are locally found in Kokee, Kauai (eco-regions) of Hawaii. Materials and Methods: To make these selections, virulent FOXY isolates were used in previous seedling inoculation trials to evaluate resistance levels among koa families in greenhouse experiments, and the most resistant families were used in the field trial reported here. Results: In this trial, survival rates two years after planting varied by family, and ranged from 45% to 95%, but all resistant families had greater survival rates than the susceptible control (25%). The trial has been converted to a seed orchard. Conclusions: The higher survival rates of the families are encouraging and seeds coming from the orchard will improve the success of future restoration and reforestation efforts. Within these resistant families it was also possible to make some selections based on height, growth, diameter, and stem form. Thus, the establishment of a wilt-resistant seed orchard results in locally adapted, eco-region specific, disease-resistant koa seed that will allow for the restoration of this iconic species and provide plant material for commercial reforestation opportunities at the landscape level. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The study of chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, started by Jane Goodall in 1960, provided pioneering accounts of chimpanzee behavior and ecology. With funding from multiple sources, including the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI) and grants from private foundations and federal programs, the project has continued for sixty years, providing a wealth of information about our evolutionary cousins. These chimpanzees face two main challenges to their survival: infectious disease — including simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz), which can cause Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in chimpanzees — and the deforestation of land outside the park. A health monitoring program has increased understanding of the pathogens affecting chimpanzees and has promoted measures to characterize and reduce disease risk. Deforestation reduces connections between Gombe and other chimpanzee populations, which can cause loss of genetic diversity. To promote habitat restoration, JGI facilitated participatory village land use planning, in which communities voluntarily allocated land to a network of Village Land Forest Reserves. Expected benefits to people include stabilizing watersheds, improving water supplies, and ensuring a supply of forest resources. Surveys and genetic analyses confirm that chimpanzees persist on village lands and remain connected to the Gombe population. Many challenges remain, but the regeneration of natural forest on previously degraded lands provides hope that conservation solutions can be found that benefit both people and wildlife. Conservation work in the Greater Gombe Ecosystem has helped promote broader efforts to plan and work for conservation elsewhere in Tanzania and across Africa. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) plays a key role in enhancing resistance to plant stress and diseases, thus improving soil structure. To better understand the effects of coal mining subsidence and mining-after transplanted trees on soil AMF diversity, this study, using spore isolation as well as identification and high-throughput sequencing techniques, analysed the AMF composition and diversity and its correlation with soil factors from three areas—namely, the original undisturbed area (C), mining-after naturally restoring area (S), and post-subsidence artificially planted 6-year-restoring areas (S1, S2, S3, S4). The results showed significant differences in the AMF diversity of the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil in the coal mining subsidence area. Furthermore, transplanted trees affected the soil TN, AP, and TP nutrients. A total of 15 species from four families and seven genera of AMF were isolated and identified from soil samples in the study areas. The relative abundances of these AMF species were: Glomus (59.83–92.57%), Diversispora (0.59–32.73%), Scutellospora (0.59–7.1%), and others (0–0.05%). The most abundant species were Glomus-lamellosu-VTX00193 (3.65–22.64%), followed by Glomus-viscosum-VTX00063 (1.57–7.58%), Glomus-MO-G18-VTX00064 (0.59–10.93%), and Glomus-perpusillum-VTX00287 (0.62–19.47%). Among them, 13 and 15 species in four families from seven genera were isolated from non-rhizosphere and rhizosphere soil of the transplanted tree species, respectively. The morphological diversity and molecular diversity in C were significantly higher than those in S. Further, the AMF diversity in S3 was higher than that in S. TN, AK, and WC were the most influential soil environmental factors for the AMF community structure in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil samples of each transplanted tree species. This study found that subsidence exerts unique effects on soil properties, and transplanted trees improved the soil properties and promoted an increase in soil AMF community diversity within the study area, S3 promoted the recovery of morphological and molecular diversity. S2 showed increased species diversity and abundance of dominant species. Therefore, the transplanted shrub mixed forests and Hippophae rhamnoides forests exhibited the most significant effects. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Forest succession is a key driver of plant communities and understanding succession is central to forest restoration. Currently, the information on the response of the microbial community to the forest succession process, however, is limited. In the present study, we investigated the dynamics of the soil bacterial community in three forest types undergoing succession caused by pine wilt disease, representing the initial pine forest, gradual mixed pine and broadleaved forest, and eventual broadleaved forest, using Illumina MiSeq coupled with Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) analysis. The results showed that the soil pH, contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (TN) increased after the occurrence of initial succession and differed among the forest sites. The mixed pine forest had significantly higher bacteria biomass (p < 0.05), whereas, the total microbial biomass did not differ during the succession. The bacterial community diversity and richness increased significantly following the succession process (p < 0.05). Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla across the succession, in which the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased (p < 0.05), whereas, Planctomycetes, WPS-2 and Burkholder decreased in abundance after succession occurred (p < 0.05). The three forests formed distinct bacterial community structures during the succession (p < 0.05), whereas, only two functional structures were clustered, in which the mixed and pure broadleaved forest did not differ. The dominant functional groups involved in the C cycle in the initial pure pine forest were replaced gradually by the groups involved in N and S cycles following the subsequent succession. The soil pH, soil TN and SOC were the most important factors affecting the bacterial community and functional structures during the succession. These results indicate that the bacterial community and function shift drastically in the early stages of succession, which reflects the changes in ecological environment caused by succession. The findings provide useful information to better understand the response of microbes to natural forest disturbance and highlight the importance of microbes during forest succession.

AB  - Context: Complex interactions between societies and their environment have shaped landscapes across Europe over centuries. Therefore, taking a historical perspective can be important when designing new forestry policy and management activities. Objectives: This perspective aims to improve our appreciation of how a better historical understanding of landscapes can increase our understanding of current conditions and inform current and future policy and practice. I provide a perspective on land-use legacies and forest change, with a particular emphasis on landscapes, and using the example of forestry in the United Kingdom. Methods: For this purpose, I undertook a comprehensive review of scholarly forestry literature and of relevant policy and legal documents in the UK, covering the last 100 years. Results: This brief review of the dynamics of forest landscapes in the UK over the last 100 years, shows that certain decisions, policies and management activities had major effects on the landscape, especially in terms of landscape patterns and species distribution, constraining it until today. Historic research investigated some of these legacies, leading to real change in policy and management, including a Broadleaved Policy, an Ancient Woodland Inventory, habitat restoration, habitat network and rewilding schemes. Research on past experiences of Dutch Elm disease in the UK and of similar outbreaks in other countries have guided responses to today’s tree pest/disease outbreaks and plant trade decisions. Conclusion: A better appreciation of past decisions and activities, especially in forestry, helps to anticipate landscape legacy effects and potential cross-scale interactions of new policies and practices. It may also help to better justify and negotiate new decisions and long-term planning among multiple actors. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global disruption, with the emergence of this and other pandemics having been linked to habitat encroachment and/or wildlife exploitation. High impacts of COVID-19 are apparent in some countries with large tropical peatland areas, some of which are relatively poorly resourced to tackle disease pandemics. Despite this, no previous investigation has considered tropical peatlands in the context of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Here, we review: (i) the potential for future EIDs arising from tropical peatlands; (ii) potential threats to tropical peatland conservation and local communities from COVID-19; and (iii) potential steps to help mitigate these risks. We find that high biodiversity in tropical peat-swamp forests, including presence of many potential vertebrate and invertebrate vectors, combined, in places, with high levels of habitat disruption and wildlife harvesting represent suitable conditions for potential zoonotic EID (re-) emergence. Although impossible to predict precisely, we identify numerous potential threats to tropical peatland conservation and local communities from the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes impacts on public health, with the potential for haze pollution from peatland fires to increase COVID-19 susceptibility a noted concern; and on local economies, livelihoods and food security, where impacts will likely be greater in remote communities with limited/no medical facilities that depend heavily on external trade. Research, training, education, conservation and restoration activities are also being affected, particularly those involving physical groupings and international travel, some of which may result in increased habitat encroachment, wildlife harvesting or fire, and may therefore precipitate longer-term negative impacts, including those relating to disease pandemics. We conclude that sustainable management of tropical peatlands and their wildlife is important for mitigating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and reducing the potential for future zoonotic EID emergence and severity, thus strengthening arguments for their conservation and restoration. To support this, we list seven specific recommendations relating to sustainable management of tropical peatlands in the context of COVID-19/disease pandemics, plus mitigating the current impacts of COVID-19 and reducing potential future zoonotic EID risk in these localities. Our discussion and many of the issues raised should also be relevant for non-tropical peatland areas and in relation to other (pandemic-related) sudden socio-economic shocks that may occur in future.

AB  - The prolonged lockdown imposed to contain the COrona VIrus Disease 19 COVID-19 pandemic prevented many people from direct contact with nature and greenspaces, raising alarms for a possible worsening of mental health. This study investigated the effectiveness of a simple and affordable remedy for improving psychological well-being, based on audio-visual stimuli brought by a short computer video showing forest environments, with an urban video as a control. Randomly selected participants were assigned the forest or urban video, to look at and listen to early in the morning, and questionnaires to fill out. In particular, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Form Y collected in baseline condition and at the end of the study and the Part II of the Sheehan Patient Rated Anxiety Scale (SPRAS) collected every day immediately before and after watching the video. The virtual exposure to forest environments showed effective to reduce perceived anxiety levels in people forced by lockdown in limited spaces and environmental deprivation. Although significant, the effects were observed only in the short term, highlighting the limitation of the virtual experiences. The reported effects might also represent a benchmark to disentangle the determinants of health effects due to real forest experiences, for example, the inhalation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Hybridization is a potential tool for incorporating stress tolerance in plants, particularly to pests and diseases, in support of restoration and conservation efforts. Butternut (Juglans cinerea) is a species for which hybridization has only recently begun being explored. This North American hardwood tree is threatened due to Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum (Ocj), the causal fungus of butternut canker disease (BCD), first observed in 1967. Observational evidence in some wild J. cinerea populations indicates that naturalized hybrids of J. cinerea with Japanese walnut (Juglans ailantifolia) may be more tolerant to BCD than non-admixed J. cinerea, but this has not been formally tested in a controlled trial. We aimed to examine potential BCD tolerance within and between J. cinerea and J. cinerea × J. ailantifolia hybrids and to determine if there is a difference in canker growth between BCD fungal isolates. Five-year-old J. cinerea and hybrid trees were inoculated with two Ocj fungal isolates collected from natural infections found in two different sites in Indiana, United States, and a blank control (agar only). Measurements of both artificially induced and naturally occurring cankers were taken at 8-, 12-, 20-, 24-, and 32-month post-inoculation. Differences in canker presence/absence and size were observed by fungal isolate, which could help explain some of the differences in BCD severity seen between J. cinerea populations. Smaller and fewer cankers and greater genetic gains were seen in hybrid families, demonstrating that hybrids warrant further evaluation as a possible breeding tool for developing BCD-resistant J. cinerea trees. © Copyright © 2020 Brennan, McKenna, Hoban and Jacobs.

AB  - Invasive pathogens and bark beetles have caused precipitous declines of various tree species around the globe. Here, we characterized long-term patterns of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae; MPB) attacks and white pine blister rust, an infectious tree disease caused by the pathogen, Cronartium ribicola. We focused on four dominant white pine host species in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (SEKI), including sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), western white pine (P. monticola), whitebark pine (P. albicaulis), and foxtail pine (P. balfouriana). Between 2013 and 2017, we resurveyed 152 long-term monitoring plots that were first surveyed and established between 1995 and 1999. Overall extent (plots with at least one infected tree) of white pine blister rust (blister rust) increased from 20% to 33%. However, the infection rate across all species decreased from 5.3% to 4.2%. Blister rust dynamics varied greatly by species, as infection rate decreased from 19.1% to 6.4% in sugar pine, but increased in western white pine from 3.0% to 8.7%. For the first time, blister rust was recorded in whitebark pine, but not foxtail pine plots. MPB attacks were highest in sugar pines and decreased in the higher elevation white pine species, whitebark and foxtail pine. Both blister rust and MPB were important factors associated with elevated mortality in sugar pines. We did not, however, find a relationship between previous fires and blister rust occurrence. In addition, multiple mortality agents, including blister rust, fire, and MPB, contributed to major declines in sugar pine and western white pine; recruitment rates were much lower than mortality rates for both species. Our results highlighted that sugar pine has been declining much faster in SEKI than previously documented. If blister rust and MPB trends persist, western white pine may follow similar patterns of decline in the future. Given current spread patterns, blister rust will likely continue to increase in higher elevations, threatening subalpine white pines in the southern Sierra Nevada. More frequent long-term monitoring efforts could inform ongoing restoration and policy focused on threats to these highly valuable and diverse white pines. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Chestnut forests represent an important environmental and landscape element in Europe, especially in the hill regions of southern Europe. In Italy, the total surface amount of chestnut forests is slightly expanded with 788,408 hectares, but orchards show a dramatic reduction (147,586 hectares or 20% of the total) and timber-producing stands a comparable expansion (605,888 hectares or 80%). The coppice management actually applied is considered one of the oldest forms of sustainable forest management. Over the years, coppice highlighted its versatility, resilience and multifunctionality. In this management system, in consideration of the “frequent” cutting cycles, special attention must be paid to forestry operations, because tree damage and soil compaction can trigger fungal disease and soil erosion. Frequent and repeated machine traffic increases the risk for soil degradation derived from compaction, topsoil removal and general disturbance. This study covered different forest areas and mechanization levels, in order to evaluate if the extent, type and severity of soil disturbance changed with site characteristics and logging technique. Furthermore, the study sought to obtain a better knowledge about the recovery time required for restoring the original soil properties after a disturbance has occurred. The findings showed that physical, chemical, and biological soil features were only partially disturbed by the coppicing and again that a high level of specialized mechanization does not generate heavier soil impact compared with the smaller and lighter machines deployed under the traditional and intermediate mechanization scenarios. Soil recovery in the impacted areas is already measurable one year after harvest and may be complete within the eight year—that is halfway through the standard rotation applied in the region to chestnut coppice. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) is a light-demanding, competition-intolerant, and tall forest tree species, introduced in Europe from North America at the beginning of the seventeenth century. It has an important economic role in Europe for producing wood and fruits, in agroforestry systems, as an ornamental tree for parks and avenues, for rehabilitation/restoration of degraded lands. The best sites for black walnut growth have warm and mild climates, with frequent and well-spread precipitation, and rich, deep, near neutral, well-drained and moist soils. Black walnut is a fast grower in youth and its height and diameter growth reach their peaks before age 30–35 years. It is globally the best known allelopathic species due to the juglone substance present in all parts of black walnut trees. The species is storm-resistant and not affected by any major pest or disease in Europe. It is regenerated by planting or direct seeding on bare land, in monocultures and mixed stands. The management of stands with black walnut, with a rotation period generally up to 80 years, include weeding (mandatory), cleaning-respacing (in dense stands), thinning (mostly from above), high and formative pruning (mandatory), with the aim of producing valuable wood for sliced veneer, solid furniture, flooring/parquet, cabinetry, panelling, sculpture, musical instruments, gunstocks. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - American chestnut (Castanea dentata [Marsh.] Borkh.) was once the dominant hardwood species in Eastern North America before an exotic fungal pathogen, Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr, functionally eliminated it across its range. One promising approach toward restoring American chestnut to natural forests is development of blight-tolerant trees using genetic transformation. However, transformation and related processes can result in unexpected and unintended phenotypic changes, potentially altering ecological interactions. To assess unintended tritrophic impacts of transgenic American chestnut on plant–herbivore interactions, gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) caterpillars were fed leaf disks excised from two transgenic events, Darling 54 and Darling 58, and four control American chestnut lines. Leaf disks were previously treated with an LD50 dose of either the species-specific Lymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (LdMNPV) or the generalist pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk). Mortality was quantified and compared to water blank controls. Tree genotype had a strong effect on the efficacies of both pathogens. Larval mortality from Btk-treated foliage from only one transgenic event, Darling 54, differed from its isogenic progenitor, Ellis 1, but was similar to an unrelated wild-type American chestnut control. LdMNPV efficacy was unaffected by genetic transformation. Results suggest that although genetic modification of trees may affect interactions with other nontarget organisms, this may be due to insertion effects, and variation among different genotypes (whether transgenic or wild-type) imparts a greater change in response than transgene presence. © 2019 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - “Foundation species” are widespread, abundant species that play critical roles in structuring ecosystem characteristics and processes. Ecosystem change in response to human activities, climate change, disease introduction, or other environmental conditions may promote the emergence of new foundation species or the decline of previously important foundation species. We present rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) as an example of an emerging foundation species in riparian forest and headwater stream ecosystems of the southern Appalachian Mountains and use its example to propose a dynamic approach to recognizing foundation species. As other species have declined, rhododendron has increased in abundance, biomass, and ecosystem importance, and now dominates the riparian zones and mesic uplands of much of the region. Rhododendron structures, stabilizes, and modulates functions within both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Studies of forest ecosystem response to environmental conditions indicate that rhododendron may increase the resistance and resilience of its associated ecosystems to predicted anthropogenic stress, including climate change, nitrogen enrichment, and invasive species. A more dynamic conception of foundation species as dependent on ecosystem states will help ecologists to focus on ecosystem processes and services, rather than on historically dominant species, for restoration strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forests of the Eastern United States and North Eastern Canada have been devastated by the onslaught of beech bark disease (BBD). The cultivation and management of resistant trees is an important conservation issue. Disease resistance is an interplay between tree genetics and environmental factors. To further understand resistance to BBD, this study investigates the contribution of topographic factors to both the occurrence and the severity of beech bark disease through the examination of small-scale patterns of disease. Approximately two hundred trees of the species Fagus grandifolia (American beech) located on an eighty-five-acre plot in southwestern Vermont were monitored over five years for the presence and severity of BBD. Trees were examined yearly, during which time diameter at breast height (DBH) was recorded as well as a measure of disease severity. Topographical factors (aspect, slope, curvature, elevation, and aspect • slope) were assessed as potential predictors of disease presence and severity. Two distance measures of disease presence in nearby trees were also included to control for the spatial spread of the disease. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was used to determine which subset of parameters yielded the best binary and ordinal logistic models of disease presence and rank. Bayesian analysis was used to determine the joint posterior distribution for model parameters. Slope was a both significant factors in determining disease presence. Slope • aspect was significant in determining both the presence and disease severity. DBH, time, and weighted distance to diseased trees were strong indicators of both disease presence and severity. Curvature and elevation were not significant factors. Predictive models based on identified local topographical parameters can identify environmental factors conducive to resistance which can be utilized to inform and designate regional beech restoration sites. Such models can also identify potential candidate trees for resistance screening and genetic profiling. With the more recent availability of higher resolution USGS topographic maps for the northeastern United States, it is easier to determine and evaluate ideal resistant beech habitat. From these maps we can predict regions with healthier beech trees and suggest potential ecologically favorable restoration sites only using slope and aspect. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid ʻŌhiʻa Death (ROD), caused by the fungal pathogen Ceratocystis, is killing large numbers of ʻōhiʻa trees (Metrosideros polymorpha) in Hawaiʻi. ʻŌhiʻa are a dominant tree in Hawaiian forests, have a range that goes from arid to wet forest climates, and are important for endangered species habitat and ecosystem function. To test whether actively planting ʻōhiʻa seedlings is a viable restoration strategy in areas with high ROD mortality, we planted ʻōhiʻa in a ROD-affected forest and crossed this with weeding and fencing treatments to compare ROD mortality to other stressors. We also tested for viable Ceratocystis spores in soils around planting areas. We found that seedlings were more likely to die in unweeded and unfenced treatments than controls. Although viable Ceratocystis spores were found in soil, none of the 41 dead seedlings tested positive for Ceratocystis. This indicates that competition from exotic plants and exotic feral ungulate damage are more likely to kill seedlings than ROD within the first year after planting. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Forest tree species are increasingly subject to severe mortalities from exotic pests, pathogens, and invasive organisms, accelerated by climate change. Such forest health issues are threatening multiple species and ecosystem sustainability globally. One of the most extreme examples of forest ecosystem disruption is the extirpation of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) caused by the introduction of chestnut blight and root rot pathogens from Asia. Asian species of chestnut are being employed as donors of disease resistance genes to restore native chestnut species in North America and Europe. To aid in the restoration of threatened chestnut species, we present the assembly of a reference genome for Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima) “Vanuxem,” one of the donors of disease resistance for American chestnut restoration. From the de novo assembly of the complete genome (725.2 Mb in 14,110 contigs), over half of the sequences have been anchored to the 12 genetic linkage groups. The anchoring is validated by genetic maps and in situ hybridization to chromosomes. We demonstrate the value of the genome as a platform for research and species restoration, including signatures of selection differentiating American chestnut from Chinese chestnut to identify important candidate genes for disease resistance, comparisons of genome organization with other woody species, and a genome-wide examination of progress in backcross breeding for blight resistance. This reference assembly should prove of great value in the understanding, improvement, and restoration of chestnut species. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Forest degradation is threatening the biodiversity of moist tropical forests since the beginning of their development. Bangladesh is losing its forests and associated biodiversity continuously due to forest-dependent livelihoods. The only freshwater swamp forest of the Ratargul Special Biodiversity Protection Area in Bangladesh is also very prone to degradation due to anthropogenic disturbance. This distinct swamp forest has unique biological diversity compared to other forest types. To assess its degradation and to propose implications for conservation, sentinel images with 10×10 m resolution were used. Also, field data were collected and analyzed. This research produced a map of forest cover change and outlined an area that can be used in restoration planning. Branch cutting, dry season overgrazing, illegal tree felling, fuelwood collection, trampling by tourists, and insect and disease epidemics were identified as causes of degradation. Functional conservation effort ensured by strong political will and area-specific forest protection regulation is essential for the conservation of last swamp forest and its remnant biodiversity. Community-based conservation approaches need to be applied for mass awareness regarding this ecosystem's value and its sustainability. © 2020 Istanbul University-Cerrahpa?a. All right reserved.

AB  - The Caspian boxwood (Buxus hyrcana) is an endangered, evergreen species in the Hyrcanian forests. The prevalence of pests and boxwood blight disease are bound to reduce the genetic diversity of this species in the near future. Accordingly, the current study considered habitat conservation and restoration by evaluating the genetic diversity of different Caspian boxwood populations. Ninety-seven accessions from seven geographic regions of Hyrcanian forests in Iran were investigated to determine genetic diversity and differentiation among and between populations using 10 ISSR primers. Results showed that the inter-population genetic diversity in B. hyrcana was estimated to be higher than intra-population genetic diversity. Principal coordinates analysis was performed on the populations, along with cluster (based on the Nei distance) and Bayesian structure analysis which classified the populations based on their distance from the sea and their altitude above sea level. Our findings suggest that geographic and environmental factors have an essential role in shaping regional gene flow and influence the genetic structure of B. hyrcana populations in the Hyrcanian forests. © 2020, Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The kelp biome is an assemblage of forest forming seaweeds of the order Laminariales (macroalgae). They occur in cool waters in shallow temperate and deep tropical seas. Similar to terrestrial forests, the kelp biome has a three-dimensional structure which provides habitats for a diversity of associated fauna and flora. Sea surface temperature, water motion, light penetration and nutrient availability control the distribution of kelp forests. Factors such as violent storms, diseases, environmental fluctuations, overgrazing, pollution, and sediment influx from land can cause loss of kelp forests. Establishing marine reserves and improving water clarity by reducing sediment inputs can restore and protect kelp forests. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The anti-inflammatory property of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) has been exploited in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with promising results. However, it remains unclear if PUFA play a significant role in the resolution of inflammation and promotion of mucosal healing. Krill oil (KO) is a natural product rich in PUFA and the potent antioxidant, astaxanthin. In this study, we attempted to understand the mechanisms through which KO modulates the gut microbiome and metabolome using in vitro and in vivo colitis models and a multi-omics based approach. Results: KO significantly decreased LPS-induced IL1β and TNFα expression in human macrophages in vitro in a dose-dependent manner by regulating a broad spectrum of signaling pathways, including NF-κB and NOD-like receptor signaling, and displayed a synergistic effect with COX2 and IKK2 inhibitors in attenuating inflammatory pathways. Moreover, KO was involved in the resolution of inflammation by promoting M2 polarization and enhancing macrophage-mediated intracellular bacterial killing. Parasite-dependent intestinal mucosal damage and microbial dysbiosis induced by Trichuris suis infection in pigs were partially restored by feeding KO. KO supplementation reduced the abundance of Rickettsiales and several species of Lactobacillus, which were among the important features identified by random forests analysis contributing to classification accuracy for KO supplementation. Several microbial signatures with strong predictive power for the status of both infection and supplementation were identified. The inhibitory effect of KO on histidine metabolism was identified using untargeted metabolomics. KO supplementation reduced several key metabolites related to histamine metabolism by suppressing the expression of a gene encoding l-histidine decarboxylase in the colon mucosa and reducing histamine biosynthesis of microbial origin. Moreover, the pro-resolving properties of KO were validated using a Citrobacter rodentium-induced Th1-dependent colitis murine model. Further, microbial signatures with high prediction accuracy for colitis-related pathophysiological traits were identified in mice. Conclusion: The findings from this study provided a mechanistic basis for optimizing microbiome-inspired alternative therapeutics in the management of IBD. The microbial signatures identified, particularly those with strong predictive accuracy for colitis phenotypes, will facilitate the development of biomarkers associated with appropriate dietary intervention to manage intestinal inflammation.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a gastrointestinal disease. The link between gut microbiota and the inflammatory response in the gut has been recently established. Restoration of gut microbiota suppresses inflammatory signaling. Kuijieling (KJL) decoction, an experimental Chinese medicine formula could ameliorate the symptom of colitis. However, the involvement of gut microbiota in its curative effect remains known. Here, we would like to assess the therapeutic effect of KJL in DSS-induced UC model. Mouse feces were collected, followed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Kuijieling decoction improved gut microbial homeostasis and suppressed inflammation in the UC model. A 5-fold cross-validation and random forest analysis identified seven signature bacterial taxa representing the DSS-mediated pathogenic condition and recovery stage upon KJL decoction treatment. Overall, the findings support the notion of KJL decoction-mediated restoration of gut microbiota as a critical step of inducing remission and alleviating UC symptoms. In the present investigation, we aimed to address the question of whether KJL decoction alleviates the UC symptoms by manipulating the gut microbial structure and function. © FEMS 2020.

AB  - A percentage of celiac disease (CD) patients develop refractory type-2 disease (RCD2), a condition associated with increased risk of enteropathy-associated T-cell-lymphoma (EATL) and without therapeutic option. Therefore, we profiled the miRNome in series of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs), CD, RCD1 or 2 and in the murine interleukin-15 (IL15)-transgenic (TG) model of RCD. The transcriptome was analyzed in 18 intestinal T-cell lymphomas (ITLs). Bioinformatics pipelines provided significant microRNA (miRNA) lists and predicted targets that were confirmed in a second set of patients. Our data show that ITLs have a unique miRNA profile with respect to other PTCLs. The c-MYC regulated miR-17/92 cluster distinguishes monomorphic epitheliotropic ITL (MEITL) from EATL and prognosticates EATL outcome. These miRNAs are decreased in IL15-TG mice upon Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition. The random forest algorithm identified a signature of 38 classifier miRNAs, among which, themiR-200 and miR-192/215 families were progressively lost in RCD2 and ITL-CD, whereas miR-17/92 and C19MCmiRNAs were up-regulated. Accordingly, SMAD3,MDM2, c-Myc and activated-STAT3 were increased in RCD2 and EATL tissues while JAK inhibition in IL15-TG mice restored their levels to baseline. Our data suggest that miRNAs circuit supports activation of STAT3 and c-Myc oncogenic signaling in RCD2, thus contributing to lymphomagenesis. This novel understanding might pave the way to personalized medicine approaches for RCD and EATL. ©2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The direct and indirect impact of fish farms, shellfish aquaculture, and extensive forms of aquaculture such as seeding of juvenile sea urchins, on macrophytes (seaweeds and seagrasses), is reviewed in Mediterranean benthic ecosystems. Fish farms constitute a source of organic matter and nutrients (food and fecal pellets) that causes the extirpation of Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows beneath and near to farm facilities. In addition to direct effects, the nitrogen enrichment of macrophytes tissues increases the grazing pressure by herbivorous fishes and sea urchins. In some cases, the impact can continue to increase several years after the cessation of farming activities. Natural restoration of extirpated seagrass meadows is generally unlikely at the human time scale. Shellfish aquaculture is the cause of the main flow of introduced macrophytes in the Mediterranean; the main vector is the importation of oyster spat from Japan and Korea. North-eastern Pacific seaweeds are now the dominant biotic component of some Mediterranean lagoons (e.g., Thau, Mar Piccolo, and Venice lagoons). In addition to direct effects, mussel aquaculture can constitute a source of larvae that flow with currents, the adults of which can overwhelm seaweed forests (e.g., Carpodesmia mediterranea). Shellfish aquaculture is also a source of fecal pellets, resulting in changes in bottom macrophytes, and a vector of diseases of metazoans, the extirpation of which may change the functioning of recipient macrophyte ecosystems. The edible sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus is sometimes erroneously considered as in decline due to over-harvesting. However, its abundance in the second half of the 20th century was probably a consequence of human impact (overfishing of its predatory fish, organic pollution. This man-induced proliferation resulted in the extirpation of seaweed forests (e.g., Carpodesmia spp., Treptacantha spp. – formerly Cystoseira spp. – Sargassum spp.; many species are endemic), which play a key role in Mediterranean coastal ecosystems. Therefore, the attempts to restore sea urchin abundance, via seeding of juveniles from hatcheries, has further artificialized the habitats rather than contributing to the restoration of natural ecosystems. Good practices guidelines are proposed aimed at minimizing the impact of aquaculture on macrophytes. © Copyright © 2020 Boudouresque, Blanfuné, Pergent, Pergent-Martini, Perret-Boudouresque and Thibaut.

AB  - [Background] As a key component of terrestrial ecosystems, forest is of important ecological and social functions, while forest health is the prerequisite of ensuring the playing of these functions. Scientific assessment of the health status of forest stands can provide an important basis for function-oriented protection forest management. [ Methods] Based on the survey data of forests health and the actual situation of shelterbelts in Dahuofang Reservoir, this study identified 4 aspects of “system vitality-organization-resilience-water conservation " as the criteria layer framework for the health assessment of water conservation forests, and then 17 indicators were selected to form a forest health assessment index system. The forest comprehensive health index (H) of different forest stands were calculated by the comprehensive index method, and according to 5 level of high quality, healthy, sub-healthy, unhealthy and disease, and the forest health for 5 typical shelterbelts (Larix gmelinii, Pinus tabuliformis, Pinus koraiensis, Robinia pseudoacacia and natural secondary forest) were analyzed. [Results] 1) The average forest heath comprehensive index of water conservation forest in Dahuofang Reservoir is 5. 77, which is sub-healthy. Fifteen plots are in three states of healthy, sub-healthy and unhealthy, respectively, with the values of 7, 5 and 3 respectively. 2) For different forests, the forest health comprehensive index(H) of different forests ranks as natural secondary forest (7. 29) > R. pseudoacacia (6. 67) > P. koraiensis (5. 88) > P. tabuliformis (5. 79) > L. gmelin (3. 21). Among them, the health status of the natural secondary forest is the best, and their forest structure, forest litter, and soil properties of forest land are obviously superior, with high structural stability and water conservation capacity. R. pseudoacacia is also in a healthy level, especially in terms of system vitality and water conservation. P. tabuliformis and P. koraiensis are in a sub-health state, and they have the conditions of transferring to healthy forests; L. gmelinii is unhealthy, which is significantly worse than other forests and needs to be improved. [Conculsions] The forests health of artificial forest is worse than that of natural secondary forest as its incomplete structure, the weak function stability, the weak anti-interference ability and the restoring force, and the weak ability of water conservation; the same is true for overall health values. Therefore, practical forest management measures should be taken to improve the health status of artificial forest, and natural secondary forests are a transformation target. © 2020, Editorial Board of Science of Soil and Water Conservation.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic syndrome characterized by insulin dysfunction and abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism. The gut microbiome has been recently identified as an important factor for development of T2D. In this study, a total of 102 subjects were recruited, and we have looked at the gut microbiota of prediabetics (PreDMs) (n = 17), newly diagnosed diabetics (NewDMs) (n = 11), and diabetics on antidiabetic treatment (KnownDMs) (n = 39) and compared them with healthy nondiabetics (ND) (n = 35). Twenty-five different serum biomarkers were measured to assess the status of diabetes and their association with gut microbiota. Our analysis revealed nine different genera as differentially abundant in four study groups. Among them, Akkermansia, Blautia, and Ruminococcus were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) decreased, while Lactobacillus was increased in NewDMs compared to ND and recovered in KnownDMs. Akkermansia was inversely correlated with HbA1c and positively correlated with total antioxidants. Compared to ND, there was increased abundance of Megasphaera, Escherichia, and Acidaminococcus and decreased abundance of Sutterella in KnownDMs. Among many taxa known to act as community drivers during disease progression, we observed genus Sutterella as a common driver taxon among all diabetic groups. On the basis of the results of random forest analysis, we found that the genera Akkermansia and Sutterella and that the serum metabolites fasting glucose, HbA1c, methionine, and total antioxidants were highly discriminative factors among studied groups. Taken together, our data revealed that gut microbial diversity of NewDMs but not of PreDMs is significantly different from that of ND. Interestingly, after antidiabetic treatment, the microbial diversity of KnownDMs tends to recover toward that of ND. IMPORTANCE Gut microbiota is considered to play a role in disease progression, and previous studies have reported an association of microbiome dysbiosis with T2D. In this study, we have attempted to investigate gut microbiota of ND, PreDMs, NewDMs, and KnownDMs. We found that the genera Akkermansia and Blautia decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in treatment-naive diabetics and were restored in KnownDMs on antidiabetic treatment. To the best of our knowledge, comparative studies on shifts in the microbial community in individuals of different diabetic states are lacking. Understanding the transition of microbiota and its association with serum biomarkers in diabetics with different disease states may pave the way for new therapeutic approaches for T2D. © 2020 Gaike et al.

AB  - In the article, the authors analyze how, under the influence of the social and technological development of the world, one of the fundamentals of the biosphere is transformed, which includes biogeo-exchange phenomena and processes, alone with the soil cover, living substances of the planet and the living environment formed by it. The active and growing technogenic influence of the society on the biospheric nature begins with the formation of a productive economy, massively building the inanimate artificial world which is called the technosphere. The statistical material analyzes the negative impact of a technogenic society on the constituent parts of the natural nutrient cycle and the losses in soil metabolic processes with destructing the planet soil covers, vast spaces of biospheric forests and injuries. It results in socializing the most important parts of natural gyros replacing it with anthropo-technogenic cycle. This is accompanied by transforming people and domesticated living organisms into the technospheric conditions of urban life in which pathological, genetic and other diseases of the human body, as well as socialized animals, develop. The authors conclude: as a result of the technocratic development of the Earth's land surface, the anthropo-technogenic cycle of substances is becoming an important part of changing the life evolution - from biospherebiological to sociotechnological, or post-biospheric. Consequently, for preserving biospheric life, it is necessary to reasonably restore many of its fundamentals, including the biotic circulation, the unification of the peoples of the world under the auspices of the UN to jointly solve this global problem. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Forest bathing is suggested to have beneficial effects on various aspects of human health. Terpenes, isoprene based-phytochemicals emitted from trees, are largely responsible for these beneficial effects of forest bathing. Although the therapeutic effects of terpenes on various diseases have been revealed, their effects on neuronal health have not yet been studied in detail. Here, we screened 16 terpenes that are the main components of Korean forests using Drosophila Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models to identify which terpenes have neuroprotective effects. Six out of the 16 terpenes, ρ-cymene, limonene (+), limonene (−), linalool, α-pinene (+), and β-pinene (−), partially suppressed the beta amyloid 42 (Aβ42)-induced rough eye phenotype when fed to Aβ42-expressing flies. Among them, limonene (+) restored the decreased survival of flies expressing Aβ42 in neurons during development. Limonene (+) treatment did not affect Aβ42 accumulation and aggregation, but did cause to decrease cell death, reactive oxygen species levels, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, and inflammation in the brains or the eye imaginal discs of Aβ42-expressing flies. This neuroprotective effect of limonene (+) was not associated with autophagic activity. Our results suggest that limonene (+) has a neuroprotective function against the neurotoxicity of Aβ42 and, thus, is a possible therapeutic reagent for AD. © 2020 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan

AB  - Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neurodegenerative conditions may be difficult to discriminate clinically from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). It is critical that we are able to do this accurately and as early as possible in order that future disease modifying therapies for PSP may be deployed at a stage when they are likely to have maximal benefit. Analysis of gait and related tasks is one possible means of discrimination. Research Question: Here we investigate a wearable sensor array coupled with machine learning approaches as a means of disease classification. Methods: 21 participants with PSP, 20 with PD, and 39 healthy control (HC) subjects performed a two minute walk, static sway test, and timed up-and-go task, while wearing an array of six inertial measurement units. The data were analysed to determine what features discriminated PSP from PD and PSP from HC. Two machine learning algorithms were applied, Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF). Results: 17 features were identified in the combined dataset that contained independent information. The RF classifier outperformed the LR classifier, and allowed discrimination of PSP from PD with 86 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity, and PSP from HC with 90 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity. Using data from the single lumbar sensor only resulted in only a modest reduction in classification accuracy, which could be restored using 3 sensors (lumbar, right arm and foot). However for maximum specificity the full six sensor array was needed. Significance: A wearable sensor array coupled with machine learning methods can accurately discriminate PSP from PD. Choice of array complexity depends on context; for diagnostic purposes a high specificity is needed suggesting the more complete array is advantageous, while for subsequent disease tracking a simpler system may suffice. © 2020

AB  - In the western United States, restoration of forests with historically frequent, low-severity fire regimes often includes fuel reduction that reestablish open, early-seral conditions while reducing fuel continuity and loading. Between 2001 and 2016, fuel reduction (e.g., thinning, prescribed burning, etc.) was implemented on over 26 million hectares of federal lands alone in the United States, reflecting the urgency to mitigate risk from high-severity wildfire. However, between 2001 and 2012, nearly 20 million hectares in the United States were impacted by mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae), compounding restoration effects in wildfire-hazard-treated stands. Knowledge of the effects of treatments followed by natural disturbance on long-term forest structure and communities is needed, especially considering that fuel treatments are increasingly being implemented and warming climate is predicted to exacerbate disturbance frequency and severity. We tested the interacting effects of treatments designed to reduce high-severity wildfire hazard in stands subsequently challenged by MPB outbreak on vegetation dynamics using a factorial experimental design (control, thin only, burn only, thin + burn) in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated forest. Stands were treated by 2002, then impacted by MPB outbreak from 2005 to 2012. We assessed change in overstory and understory forest community structure, composition, and diversity over time. There were distinct thinning, burning, and year effects. Thinning immediately reduced overstory density; pine density then declined 4.5 times more in unthinned than thinned treatments due to MPB. Burning immediately reduced graminoid, shrub, and total understory cover by as much as 52%, resulting in greater species evenness than unburned treatments, but differences disappeared by 2016 due to growth and MPB outbreak. Similarly, multivariate analyses indicated forest communities were starkly different after treatment but became more similar over time, though key understory and overstory attributes still distinguish control and thin + burn. This study shows the value of long-term silvicultural experiments to evaluate treatment longevity and the compounded effects of treatment and natural disturbance. We demonstrate the homogenizing effects of treatment-induced growth coupled with MPB-caused tree mortality on management strategies that just treat the overstory (thinning) or understory (burning), showing that only combined treatments can provide the unique structural and compositional outcomes expected of restoration. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - Non-native pathogens and pests cause high mortality to tree species globally and may imperil the future viability of associated forest ecosystems. Phytophthora lateralis, an oomycete, causes Port-Orford-cedar root disease and is a major cause of mortality in the ecologically and economically important conifer species Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (Port-Orford-cedar). The P. lateralis resistance program shows promise to help stabilize C. lawsoniana in its native range of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon, USA, and serves as a leading example of disease resistance breeding in forest trees. Summary A non-native, invasive pathogen, Phytophthora lateralis, has caused extensive mortality within the native range, northern California and southern Oregon USA, of Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (Port-Orford-cedar), as well as in horticultural and amenity plantings in the USA and Europe. Restoration of affected sites is contingent upon development of populations with genetic resistance. Naturally occurring genetic resistance has been identified in C. lawsoniana, and an active selective breeding program seeks to characterize and increase resistance levels. Two seedling root dip inoculation trials, assessed for mortality for nearly three years each, are used to examine the types and levels of genetic resistance in C. lawsoniana. Most seedlings utilized in these trials are progeny of crosses from parent trees that exhibited apparent resistance to the disease in earlier trials. Seedling trials suggest that both qualitative major gene and quantitative disease resistance occurs in C. lawsoniana. Both types of resistance to P. lateralis appear to be present at levels high enough to be immediately useful for restoration and reforestation. The data suggest that the qualitative resistance is conditioned by a single major gene (designated here as Pla), but nothing is known about the number of genes involved in quantitative disease resistance. Seedling progeny from resistant parent trees in containerized seed orchards are now being used for restoration and reforestation. Resistant seedlings or clones could also be used to re-establish C. lawsoniana in urban forests. © 2019 The Authors, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Trust

AB  - Like many jurisdictions across North America, the province of Nova Scotia (NS) is faced with the challenge of restoring its forests to a more natural, presettlement state through implementation of ecological forestry. At the core of ecological forestry is the idea that natural forest structures and processes may be approximated by designing management practices that emulate natural disturbances. Successful natural disturbance emulation depends on fundamental knowledge of disturbance characteristics, including identification of specific disturbance agents, their spatial extent, severity, and return interval. To date, no comprehensive synthesis of existing data has been undertaken to document the natural disturbance regime of NS forests, limiting the application of natural disturbance emulation. Using over 300 years of documents and available data, we identified the main natural disturbance agents that affect NS forests and characterized their regimes. Overall, fire, wind (predominantly hurricanes), and outbreaks of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)) are the most important disturbance agents, causing substantial areas of low-(&lt;30% mortality), moderate-(30%–60%), and high-(&gt;60%) severity disturbance. While characterization of natural historic fire is challenging, due to past human ignitions and suppression, we estimated that the mean annual disturbance rate of moderate-to high-severity fire ranged between 0.17% and 0.4%·year−1 (return interval of 250– 600 years), depending on ecosystem type. Hurricanes make landfall in NS, on average, every 7 years, resulting in wide-scale (&gt;500 ha) forest damage. While hurricane track and damage severity vary widely among storms, the return interval of low-to high-severity damage is 700–1250 years (0.14%–0.08%·year−1). Conversely, the return interval of host-specific spruce budworm outbreaks is much shorter (&lt;50 years) but more periodic, causing wide-scale, low-to high-severity damage to spruce–fir forests every 30–40 years. Further disturbance agents such as other insects (e.g., spruce beetle), diseases, ice storms, drought, and mammals can be locally important and (or) detrimental to individual tree species but contribute little to overall disturbance in NS. Climate change is expected to significantly alter the disturbance regime of NS, affecting current disturbances (e.g., increased fire) and driving the introduction of novel agents (e.g., hemlock wooly adelgid), and continued monitoring is needed to understand these changes. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

AB  - Objective: The focus of this study is to monitor the effect of lockdown on the various air pollutants due to COVID-19 pandemic and identify the ones that affect COVID-19 fatalities so that measures to control the pollution could be enforced. Methods: Various machine learning techniques: Decision Trees, Linear Regression and Random Forest have been applied to correlate air pollutants and COVID-19 fatalities in Delhi. Furthermore, a comparison between the concentration of various air pollutants and the air quality index during lockdown period and last two years 2018 and 2019 has been presented. Results: From the experimental work, it has been observed that the pollutants Ozone and Toluene have increased during the lockdown period. It has also been deduced that the pollutants that may impact the mortalities due to COVID-19 are Ozone, NH3, NO2, and PM10. Conclusions: The novel corona virus has led to environmental restoration due to lockdown. However, there is a need to impose measures to control Ozone pollution as there has been a significant increase in its concentration and it also impacts the COVID-19 mortality rate. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - The present review examines the restorative potential of interaction with flora for the physical and mental health of a person and their psychological well-being. The plant world is a particular part of nature, characterized by responsiveness, aesthetic appeal, and unobtrusiveness. These features make plants an effective means of restoring cognitive abilities, emotional state, as well as developing personal and behavioral effectiveness. At the same time, it is noted that, due to the phenomenon of plant blindness, their recovery resource is not used enough. The types of eco-therapy are analyzed; theories explaining the mechanisms of plants’ influence on the people’s psyche (biophilia hypothesis, attention restoration theory, stress recovery/reduction theory, and phyto-resonance) are presented. We review the results of studies proving the beneficial effect of interactions with the plant world (gardening, walking in the forest and park, simulation of the natural environment) on physical health and recovery from somatic diseases, on attention, creativity, behavior, and social functioning of a person. The effectiveness of interaction with flora is also noteworthy in the case of working with particular groups of people (adolescents from risk groups, offenders, and psychiatric patients). We analyze the limitations of studies, mainly related to their design. © 2020 Medico-Biological and Socio-Psychological Issues of Safety in Emergency Situations. All rights reserved.

AB  - Often, exotic trees grow very fast in their new environments and sometimes even faster than the indigenous ones. These exotics seem to be tougher and live through harsher conditions. They may be drought resistant, and they can survive long periods with little to no rainfall. These trees are fast growing and are resistant to pests and diseases which tend to damage the locally growing trees. Moreover, these trees can help improve soil physical and chemical properties. Hence, the objective of this study was to compare the physical and chemical properties of soil under different tree plantations, namely Fucalyptus urophylla, Acacia crassicapa and Acacia aulacocarpa at the Saithong Silvicultural Research Station. Three soil composite samples were collected from soil depths of 0-10, 10-30, and 30-50 cm, in the three stands aged 27-year old and planted at a spacing of 2 x 2 m. Soil type in these stands was sandy loam. Soil moisture percentage (12.85%) was significantly the highest in the E. urophylla plantation. Phosphorus (18.2 mg/kg DW), magnesium (6.98 cmolc/kg DW), and potassium (6.98 cmok/kg DW) contents were also the greatest in the E. urophylla plantation. Organic matter content was the highest in the A. crassicapa plantation (7.59%), while nitrogen (0.04%) and calcium (36.17cmolc/kg DW) contents were the highest in the A. aulacocarpa plantation. Significant differences were also observed in the soil bulk density and porosity attributable to structure, tillage, cropping practices, soil depth and compaction. Characterization of soil pore system is equally important in understanding soil physical and parent material composition, which has a direct impact on soil chemistry and fertility. Parent material rich in soluble ions (calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium) is desirable, as these chemicals are easily dissolved in water and readily available for plants. For soils with poor nutrient content found in warm and humid tropical climates with low water supply, E. urophylla, A. crassicapa and A. aulacocapa have the potential to enhance the aboveground stand production. Undoubtedly, when planted, they can help restore the soil nutrients faster and therefore, can be used in forest plantations or in agroforestry farms. © 2020, Seameo Biotrop.

AB  - Damage to white pine forests by white pine blister rust, caused by the non-native invasive fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola, is affecting people across western North America. The loss of white pine forests can impact economic opportunities as well as ecosystem and human well-being. In this paper we quantify the durability, stability, and usability of natural genetic resistance to the disease in two white pine species using long-term field trials. By combining quantitative genetic resistance breeding programs with data from field validation trials, land managers and policy makers will be able to better ensure healthy forests for the future. Summary. Many tree species are susceptible to non-native pathogens or pests. Their level of susceptibility can be so severe that they are extirpated, and their use for forest restoration or reforestation is curtailed. Programs to find, enhance, and utilize genetic resistance in tree species are underway. Because trees are long-lived, resistance must be effective for decades to centuries to be useful. Resistance needs to be durable, stable, and present at a useful level. Field plantings provide the best opportunity to assess resistance durability and stability across a range of environments. In this paper we examine the durability and stability of resistance levels, previously identified in seedling screening trials, of two white pine species, Pinus monticola (western white pine) and P. lambertiana (sugar pine) to white pine blister rust, using eight 15 to 20-year-old field trials in Oregon and northern California. We found that resistance varies for each host species and in different environments. Major gene resistance (MGR) may have limited utility and the search for resistance should include all types of resistance, as quantitative disease resistance (QDR) appears to be more durable than MGR in the long term at many sites in our study. Our data provide encouragement and support for the use of long-term field validation studies in combination with quantitative genetic resistance breeding programs. We advocate for an increased use of field trials to ensure that resistance is effective for restoration and recovery against invasive pathogens and pests. No claim to US Government works

AB  - Simplification of stand structure of forests and woodlands through human-induced modification is a serious threat to biodiversity. Restoring lost habitat complexity and heterogeneity, such as woody debris, requires an understanding of the relationships between different elements that contribute to stand structure. In this study, we examine the structure and composition of a critically endangered box-gum grassy woodland in south-eastern Australia and relationships with woody debris loads. We found that: (1) despite modification by humans and differing susceptibility to dieback, the two dominant tree species, Blakeley's red gum, Eucalyptus blakelyi and yellow box, E. melliodora, occurred in similar proportions irrespective of vegetation density; (2) E. blakelyi had the largest number of stems and basal area, but while E. melliodora had fewer stems, it had a similar basal area to E. blakelyi. E. melliodora also showed fewer signs of dieback than E. blakelyi with between 40-50% trees in good condition compared to 2% for the latter species; (3) woody debris loads were low compared to other studies in woodland, but there were levels of heterogeneity indicating 'natural' accumulation was occurring; (4) tree basal area and woody debris loads had a 1:1 relationship across all sites and vegetation densities. Overall, our study indicated that ecosystem recovery was taking place (i.e. with many young trees), but there were fewer large trees that are known to supply most woody debris. Our findings highlight the slow accumulation of this critical resource because the volumes were lower than expected. Based on our results, we recommend: (1) aiming for approximately a 50:50 ratio of yellow box to Blakely's red gum basal area in woodland restoration projects; (2) to accelerate the recovery of woodland structure, addition of woody debris should be added at a minimum ratio of 1:1 to standing basal area (i.e. a basal area of 5.99 m2 requires a minimum volume of 3.11 m3) (3) managing for both volume and heterogeneity of woody debris loads; (4) preserving large diameter trees to harness proportionally higher woody debris and litter inputs. © 2020 Manning et al.

AB  - Launched in 1987, the French National Programme for the Conservation of Native Elm Genetic Resources focused on the ex situ conservation of clones of adult field elms (Ulmus minor Mill.) survivors of the Dutch elm disease (DED) pandemic. It was later expanded to include the in situ dynamic conservation of populations of European white elm (U. laevis Pall.) and wych elm (U. glabra Huds.). The national collection contains 441 clones, partly characterized and evaluated in a European project. The pathological tests and experimental plantations did not reveal clones truly resistant to DED but provided material for the restoration of hedgerows. Two conservation units of white elm and one of wych elm were selected, enriching the pan-European EUFORGEN network for dynamic conservation of forest genetic resources. This programme provides feedback on genetic conservation strategies for forest trees in a health crisis. New partners are invited to make use of the scientific potential of the clone bank and experimental plots. © SISEF https://iforest.sisef.org/.

AB  - In the northeast Pacific, the sea urchins Mesocentrotus franciscanus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus are ecologically important species that play a dominant role in intertidal and subtidal rocky ecosystems. M. franciscanus are the basis for important commercial fisheries and serve as an indigenous traditional food resource as well as model species in developmental research. Both species are important ecosystem structuring species (ecosystem engineers) that control the flow of resources within marine communities. Recent work continues to reveal factors that shape their population dynamics, role in the ecosystem, and how climate change may alter both of these. Over the past decade, the coast-wide collapse of the predatory sea star Pycnopodia helianthoides and a massive, long-lasting marine heat wave corresponded with historically stable, kelp forests transitioning to species-poor barrens dominated by M. franciscanus and S. purpuratus. In contrast, some sea urchin populations have experienced declines due to disease in southern California, toxins in northern California, expanding populations of the sea otter Enhydra lutris in Alaska and British Columbia or the recovery of sea urchin predators in California's marine protected areas. Such radical changes in population dynamics have direct and indirect consequences for the productivity and diversity of kelp forests. In northern California, the recent destruction of the kelp forest by sea urchins has had cascading impacts resulting in the collapse of both the commercial M. franciscanus and recreational red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, fisheries. Currently, there are efforts to ameliorate the proliferation of barrens or poor quality of sea urchin roe include kelp restoration through culling, sea urchin ranching, and plans for rebuilding populations of sea urchin predators. A looming question for both sea urchins and kelp forests is how climate change will affect reproduction and recruitment via larval production, development, ocean transport, budding, survival and settlement, and how these processes vary across space and time. Research continues to reveal both physiological sensitivity and resilience to effects of climate change of sea urchins, such as warming, food deficiencies, hypoxia, salinity, low pH, and ocean circulation. How both climatic effects and the ecological factors that impact the dynamics of sea urchin populations, and the ecosystems they control, remains a critical area of research for these ecologically, culturally, and commercially important species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over four billion American chestnut trees have been killed as a result of an introduced pathogen, the chestnut blight fungus. Recently, transgenic blight-tolerant American chestnut trees have been produced by inserting a gene from wheat into the American chestnut genome. Pending federal approval to use these transgenic trees for large-scale forest restoration, this would be the first instance where a transgenic approach has been used to restore a tree species that has been rendered functionally extinct by an introduced pathogen. With the help of citizen scientists, we estimate that large-scale forest restoration using blight-tolerant American chestnut trees is possible within the next few decades. Summary Breeding transgenic blight-tolerant American chestnuts with susceptible wild-type (WT) trees is potentially an efficient method to rescue the genetic diversity and adaptive capacity of the American chestnut population for large-scale restoration. To develop a breeding plan to diversify a transgenic blight-tolerant population, we simulated pedigrees to estimate inbreeding coefficients and effective population size in scenarios involving outcrossing 1–4 transgenic founders to a maximum of 1,500 WT trees over 1–5 generations. We also simulated marker-assisted introgression scenarios to minimize the extent of the transgenic founder genome, especially on the transgene carrier chromosome. Simulations suggest that the effective population size may be increased to >500, and the average inbreeding coefficient reduced to <0.01, by outcrossing a single transgenic founder over five generations to 2, 25, 50, 150, and 450 (677 total) WT parents. Three generations of marker-assisted introgression is predicted to decrease the length of the founder genome to between 7% and 13% of the transgene carrier chromosome length as compared to 42% with event selection (ES) only. Transgenic outcross selections may be intercrossed to select progeny homozygous for the transgene for planting in seed orchards. A diversified population of transgenic blight-tolerant American chestnut is estimated to be available for use in large-scale forest restoration 20–35 years after federal approval to distribute the trees. In contrast, trees from earlier generations would be available almost immediately after federal approval for personal or horticultural plantings. Methods to accelerate pollen production and outcrossing are discussed. © 2019 The Authors, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Trust

AB  - This review paper notes that the nutritional essence of an indigenous people’s diet can, broadly, be outlined in terms of their food-inherent bioactive chemical functions. Two food crops; Yam (Dioscorea spp.) and the Oil-palm (Elaeis guineensis), define Forest West Africa, agriculturally, as Yam or Palm belt. They can also be said to, broadly, define the diet of the region, which staple base they constitute, as the Yampalm Diet type. Some unique, bioactive, chemical functions of yam identified include; dioscorin, lipoic acid, potassium, biotin and, thiocyanate, while those of oil-palm include; tocotrienols, carotenoids, retinoids and lauric acid. These alkalizing food functions are, in theory, complementary to the acidic tropical physiology of Forest West Africans. Fed on other than the Yampalm diet, Forest West Africans have been demonstrated to be highly susceptible to metabolic syndrome, and some other diseases, due to adopted alien diets. Examples are lactose intolerance from milk and inflammation reaction to wheat gluten. Some food functions of Yampalm diet; dioscorin in yam and tocotrienol from oil-palm, as examples, are efficacious in metabolic syndrome management. They are potential ‘Gene-adapted food-function supplements’ for emigrants from this area who adopt alien diets. Experiments have shown that restoration of the Forest West African diet ameliorates metabolic syndrome among the people, including their Diaspora in America. Restoration of, genetically or epigenetically, adapted indigenous diet among peoples recommends itself as part of management strategy for modernization diseases. © 2019 Functional Foods in Health and Disease.

AB  - Since the mid-19th century, Pinus nigra plantations have played a key role in the restoration of degraded European landscapes. Nowadays, these plantations are aging and prone to natural disturbances, insect infestations, and diseases. For their successful gradual conversion, knowledge of optimal gap spatiotemporal dynamics is crucial. We studied herb and natural regeneration patterns along with site factors on 477 subplots within 44 plots distributed over four stand types: closed stand (14% diffuse light), open stand (21%), gap edge (23%), and gap (57%). Despite the abundant Quercus petraea, Q. cerris, and Q. pubescens mast year, no one-year seedlings were recorded, which is likely due to the summer drought. Short seedlings (h < 20 cm) of Quercus sp., Fraxinus ornus and Ostrya carpinifolia were more successful within closed stands. Short Quercus seedlings were positively associated with soil depth and negatively associated with soil nutrients, distance to seed trees, and Sesleria autumnalis coverage. Taller Quercus seedlings required more light than both of its strongest competitors and were positively related to humid soils and less rocky sites. Ungulate overbrowsing significantly impeded natural regeneration. The results indicate a satisfactory Quercus density for conversion and the importance of advanced regeneration, which should be gradually, but persistently, released by progressively widening gaps. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Human-altered disturbance regimes and changing climatic conditions can reduce seed availability and suitable microsites, limiting seedling regeneration in recovering forest systems. Thus, resprouting plants, which can persist in situ, are expected to expand in dominance in many disturbance-prone forests. However, resprouters may also be challenged by changing regimes, and the mechanisms determining facultative seedling recruitment by resprouting species, which will determine both the future spread and current persistence of these populations, are poorly understood. In the resprouter-dominated forests of coastal California, interactions between wildfire and an emerging disease, sudden oak death (SOD), alter disturbance severity and tree mortality, which may shift forest regeneration trajectories. We examine this set of compound disturbances to (1) assess the influence of seed limitation, biotic competition, and abiotic conditions on seedling regeneration in resprouting populations; (2) investigate whether disease-fire interactions alter postfire seedling regeneration, which have implications for future disease dynamics and shifts in forest composition. Following a wildfire that impacted a preexisting plot network in SOD-affected forests, we monitored seedling abundances and survival over eight years. With pre- and postfire data, we assessed relationships between regeneration dynamics and disturbance severity, biotic, and abiotic variables, using Bayesian generalized linear models and mixed models. Our results indicate that postfire seedling regeneration by resprouting species was shaped by contrasting mechanisms reflecting seed limitation and competitive release. Seedling abundances declined with decreasing postfire survival of mature, conspecific stems, while belowground survival of resprouting genets had no effect. However, where seed sources persisted, seedling abundances and survival generally increased with the prefire severity of disease impacts, suggesting that decreased competition with adults may enhance seedling recruitment in this resprouter-dominated system. Species’ regeneration responses varied with their relative susceptibility to SOD and suggest compositional shifts, which will determine future disease management and forest restoration actions. These results additionally highlight that mechanisms related to biotic competition, seed limitation, and opportunities for seedling recruitment beneath mature canopies may determine possible shifts in the occurrence of resprouting traits. This result has broad applications to other systems impacted by human-altered regimes where asexual persistence may be predicted to be a beneficial life history strategy. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Extreme climatic events have recently impacted marine ecosystems around the world, including foundation species such as corals and kelps. Here, we describe the rapid climate-driven catastrophic shift in 2014 from a previously robust kelp forest to unproductive large scale urchin barrens in northern California. Bull kelp canopy was reduced by >90% along more than 350 km of coastline. Twenty years of kelp ecosystem surveys reveal the timing and magnitude of events, including mass mortalities of sea stars (2013-), intense ocean warming (2014–2017), and sea urchin barrens (2015-). Multiple stressors led to the unprecedented and long-lasting decline of the kelp forest. Kelp deforestation triggered mass (80%) abalone mortality (2017) resulting in the closure in 2018 of the recreational abalone fishery worth an estimated $44 M and the collapse of the north coast commercial red sea urchin fishery (2015-) worth $3 M. Key questions remain such as the relative roles of ocean warming and sea star disease in the massive purple sea urchin population increase. Science and policy will need to partner to better understand drivers, build climate-resilient fisheries and kelp forest recovery strategies in order to restore essential kelp forest ecosystem services. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Acacia spp. are important tropical forest trees but their commercial value may be limited by expression of poor apical dominance and extensive lateral branching. Multiple-aged and gap silviculture may harness the developmental plasticity of phyllodinous Acacia spp. to improve regeneration establishment, without sacrificing survival rates, by delaying heteroblasty (transition early in development from true leaves to modified petioles called phyllodes). However, successful development of this system is dependent on knowledge of seedling shade tolerance and ability to establish within canopy gaps. We planted Hawaiian Acacia koa (koa) beneath an existing restoration planting with a monospecific overstory canopy of koa on a dry site within koa's natural range. Seedlings originated from a local putative drought-adapted population and a non-local mesic-adapted population, allowing evaluation of responses to a continuous light availability gradient in two populations. Leaf transition rates and the growth and survival impacts of rust fungus infection introduced from the existing canopy were also assessed. We detected significant and positive responses to light availability. Koa exhibited low shade tolerance and cannot sustain overtopping; both height and basal diameter growth increased exponentially with increasing canopy openness. Transition to high-light, drought-adapted mature foliage occurred more rapidly with increasing light availability. High developmental plasticity occurred in response to shading, but we did not find evidence of the adaptive value in that plasticity because of low survival rates and reduced growth in low-light microsites. We detected evidence for a growth-survival trade-off in which the non-local population grew faster overall, yet had reduced survival. Rust infection reduced survival and growth, limiting the possibility of converting degraded koa plantations into multiple-aged, gap silviculture systems. High rust infection rates and impacts on field performance found in this study reflect potential for pathogen-limited growth and survival in gap silviculture. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent land-use and climatic shifts are expected to alter species distributions, the provisioning of ecosystem services, and livelihoods of biodiversity-dependent societies living in multifunctional landscapes. However, to date, few studies have integrated social and ecological evidence to understand how humans perceive change, and adapt agro-ecological practices at the landscape scale. Mixed method fieldwork compared observed changes in plant species distribution across a climatic gradient to farmers’ perceptions in biodiversity and climate change in rice-cultivated farms. In contrast to the global context, farmers in the Terai Plains of Nepal are acutely aware of high levels of change observed in the last 10 years, and incrementally adapt as new invasive species emerge (93%), the incidence and severity of pest/diseases increase (66%), genetic diversity of indigenous varieties erodes (65%), forest habitats diminish (98%), irrigation water declines (60%), and wildlife ranges shift. Twenty-five changes in climate were reported by 97.5% of farmers to reduce provisioning services and food self-sufficiency, and increase exposure to waterborne pathogens, heat stress, and human or livestock mortality. The study illustrates the need for financial and institutional supports at all levels to strengthen agro-ecological practices, upscale Information Communication Technology for extension services, clarify tenure agreements, and safeguard natural ecosystems to slow biodiversity loss. Existing incentives to conserve, restore, or sustainably manage ecosystems offer lessons for other societies undergoing rapid change. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Megastigmus transvaalensis Hussey (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) parasitizes drupes of Rhus genus plants in Africa and Schinus (Anacardiaceae) in South America. This exotic wasp damages Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi drupes in native forests and ecological restoration areas in Brazil. The objective of the present study was to investigate the precipitation, temperature and relative humidity effects on M. transvaalensis flight activity, and to determine the parasitism rate and sex ratio of this wasp on S. terebinthifolia plants. The study was conducted with yellow sticky traps and S. terebinthifolia drupes collected in an ecological restoration area, from August 2014 to September 2015, in the Sorocaba municipality, São Paulo state, Brazil. Megastigmus transvaalensis populations were negatively correlated with maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation, with population peaks at the end of May 2015, with 927 insects per evaluation (48.8 adults per trap). The M. transvaalensis sex ratio was higher in the laboratory (0.42) than in the field (0.08). The parasitism rate of S. terebinthifolia drupes by M. transvaalensis ranged from zero to 36.3% under natural environmental conditions. Megastigmus transvaalensis can be monitored with yellow sticky traps. Damage by M. transvaalensis in S. terebinthifolia drupes may decrease the germination of the seeds and the establishment of this plant in native and restoration ecological areas. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Invasive pests, such as the pine wood nematode (PWN), threaten European forests. In De la Fuente, Saura, and Beck, Journal of Applied Ecology, 2018, 55, 2374, we modelled the natural spread of the PWN by the longhorn beetle (Monochamus galloprovincialis) on the Iberian Peninsula. We used the model to evaluate the effectiveness of several management measures to control the PWN spread: early detection and removal of infected trees, beetle mass trapping and clear-cut belts. We simulated these particular measures because they have been or are being applied in PWN containment efforts on the Iberian Peninsula. Martínez-Abraín and Jiménez, Journal of Applied Ecology, 2019, suggested that two other management measures would be appropriate to halt the PWN expansion: installing nest boxes for insectivorous birds in order to increase predation on vector beetles and increasing the populations of large mammalian herbivores to lower forest tree density. The results of De la Fuente, Saura, and Beck, Journal of Applied Ecology, 2018, 55, 2374 showed that a combination of measures is more likely to control PWN spread than any single one in isolation, indicating that halting this, and many other invasive species, requires a comprehensive approach. Here, we review current evidence on the efficacy of the measures proposed by Martínez-Abraín and Jiménez, Journal of Applied Ecology, 2019, as PWN management tools. This evidence suggests that, by themselves, these measures are unlikely to significantly slow down, let alone halt, the PWN spread on the Iberian Peninsula. Furthermore, we indicate how the model presented in De la Fuente, Saura, and Beck, Journal of Applied Ecology, 2018, 55, 2374 lends itself to assessing this quantitatively in future research. Synthesis and applications. Lost biotic interactions in ecosystems can make them more vulnerable to invasions, and restoring interactions can in turn increase resilience. Ecosystem restoration can thus, in theory, also benefit invasive species management. Current evidence indicates however that managing natural species interactions, such as beetle predation from insectivorous birds or herbivory by large mammals, would need to be applied in combination with other measures if they are to halt or significantly slow down the expansion of the PWN in Europe. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Native pollinators are increasingly needed on conventional farms yet rarely fostered via management. One solution is habitat restoration in marginal areas, but colonization may be constrained if resident pollinator richness is low or if restored areas fail to provide sufficient floral or nesting resources. We quantified restoration outcomes for native bees, and associated resources, on three conventional farms with forb-grass prairie plantings on marginal areas of varying sizes, in a heavily farmed region of central North America. We tested bee abundance and richness in restored prairie versus the dominant habitats of the region—crops, forest remnants, and edges of fields and roads. Restored prairie supported 2× more species (95 of 119 total species) and 3× more bees (72% of captured individuals) compared to the other cover types. All richness and abundance differences among habitat types were associated with higher floral resources in restored prairie. Thirty percent of the bee species were unique to prairie, consistent with long-distance dispersal but begging the question of origin given the absence of prairie regionally. Our results suggest that road and field edges may be the source, as these areas had more floral and nesting resources than forest or crop fields combined and supported 55% of all species despite covering only approximately 5% of the sampled farms. Habitat scarcity is not the only constraint on native bees in agricultural landscapes, with increasing concern over disease and chemicals. However, we observed that restored areas on marginal lands of conventional farms can support abundant and species-rich populations of native bees. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis. Engelm.) is vulnerable to a number of threats including an introduced pathogen (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch.), epidemic levels of native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), fire suppression, and climate change. To describe the structure of whitebark pine populations in two national parks in the southern Cascades (Crater Lake, Oregon, USA (CRLA) and Lassen Volcanic, California, USA (LAVO) National Parks), we surveyed trees in 30 × 50 × 50 m plots in both parks. We used these plots to describe the extent of white pine blister rust (the disease caused by Cronartium ribicola), mountain pine beetle occurrence, and to elucidate factors influencing the presence of pests and pathogens, cone production, and canopy kill. In each plot, we recorded data related to tree health, including symptoms of blister rust and mountain pine beetle, and reproductive vigor (cone production). In both parks, encroachment from other species, particularly mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière), was negatively associated with cone production. In CRLA, water stress was a good predictor of blister rust infection and cone production. For CRLA and LAVO, the presence of mountain pine beetle and blister rust was associated with higher canopy kill for whitebark pine. Lastly, we found evidence for a pest-pathogen interaction, mountain pine beetle attack was greater for trees that showed symptoms of blister rust infection in CRLA. Our results indicate that whitebark pine populations in the southern Cascade Range are experiencing moderate levels of blister rust infection compared with other sites across the species range, and that competition from shade-tolerant species may result in an additional threat to whitebark pine in both parks. We present our findings in the context of park management and situate them in range-wide and regional conservation strategies aimed at the protection and restoration of a declining species. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of a previously un-studied wild mushroom, Echinodontium tinctorium, collected from the forests of north-central British Columbia. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophage model was used to study the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. The crude alkaline extract demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory activity, and was further purified using a “bio-activity-guided-purification” approach. The size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography yielded a water-soluble anti-inflammatory polysaccharide (AIPetinc). AIPetinc has an average molecular weight of 5 kDa, and is a heteroglucan composed of mainly glucose (88.6%) with a small amount of galactose (4.0%), mannose (4.4%), fucose (0.7%), and xylose (2.3%). In in vivo settings, AIPetinc restored the histamine-induced inflammatory event in mouse gluteus maximus muscle, thus confirming its anti-inflammatory activity in an animal model. This study constitutes the first report on the bioactivity of Echinodontium tinctorium, and highlights the potential medicinal benefits of fungi from the wild forests of northern British Columbia. Furthermore, it also reiterates the need to explore natural resources for alternative treatment to modern world diseases. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - At present most of the peatland in the OKI district, South Sumatra was damaged by forest fires. One way to restore the condition and function of peatlands as before is to rehabilitate by replanting suitable species on peatlands. One of the obstacles to the planting success on peatlands is the presence of pests and diseases. This study aims to determine pests and diseases of forest plants in several locations of burned peatlands in South Sumatra. The method used in this study was a survey method by direct observation of sample plants. Parameters observed were species of insect pests and pathogen, incidence and intensity of the attack. The results showed that several insect pests and diseases were found on burned peatland in Ogan Komering Ilir district, South Sumatra and identified as Cycnotrachelus sp., Valanga nigricornis, bagworm, Daphnis hypothous, Macrophoma sp., Pestalotiopsis sp., and Cephaleuros sp. The highest incidence of bagworm attacks was on Shorea balangeran and categorized as very heavy damage. The highest intensity was occurred on Dyera lowii that were attacked by Cephaleuros sp. and was categorized as moderately heavy damage. Even though the pest and disease attacks brought no economic losses, they must be watched closely by continuous monitoring. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forests bear the historical legacies of human activities over thousands of years, including agriculture, trade, disease and resource extraction. Many of these activities may represent indices of the proposed geological epoch of the Anthropocene. Modifications to soil, topography and vegetation evidence anthropogenic influences. Yet studies of vegetation change throughout the humid tropics tend to occlude these influences by focussing on forest dynamics, timber, and biodiversity through permanent sample plots or forestry inventory plots. We highlight how history and social science can be combined with ecology to help better understand human signatures in forest dynamics. We (1) critically review ecological methods in the light of the environmental and social history of the Afrotropics; (2) map current plot networks for West and Central Africa in relation to the Human Footprint Index; (3) using two case-studies, demonstrate how history and social science bring new insights and inferences to plot-based studies; all leading to (4) novel forms of interdisciplinary collaboration for sustainable forest conservation, management and restoration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Loss of native foundation tree species to introduced pests profoundly alters the structure and function of many forest ecosystems. Recent advances to resurrect or prevent the loss of species by developing resistant hybrids hold promise, but uncertainty remains about the potential impacts of introducing a novel genotype on ecological processes, such as fire. A classic example of a non-native, pathogen-caused loss of a foundation species is American chestnut (Castanea dentata), a species now functionally extinct from the eastern US but undergoing experimental trials to resurrect the species with a putatively disease-resistant genotype. We compared the litter flammability among American chestnut, Chinese chestnut (C. mollisima), and a population of first intercross, third-generation backcrossed hybrid (BC3F2) using laboratory burning experiments. Litter flammability of American chestnut was consistently greater than Chinese chestnut, whereas the hybrid had an intermediate flammability or more closely resembled Chinese chestnut flammability by some measures. Greater flammability in American chestnut was associated with a longer leaf structure with greater curling when dry. American chestnut had flammability properties consistent with other pyrophytic species present in contemporary fire-prone ecosystems. The loss of American chestnut may have altered litter flammability of some eastern US forest ecosystems, a result more commonly associated with compositional changes in conjunction with fire exclusion and other disturbances. Resurrecting American chestnut with a hybrid genotype may mitigate this change in areas where less flammable species have replaced American chestnut. Resurrection of lost foundation species through introduction of resistant genotypes may represent a resounding ecological success story, but unanticipated changes to ecological processes, such as fire, should be considered. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Nearshore kelp forest ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change and ocean warming, which can alter community dynamics and change the trajectory of species recovery in unpredictable ways. Abalone (Haliotis spp.) populations in the Southern California Bight (SCB) are still recovering from a combination of overfishing and disease, despite the closure of the fisheries 20 years ago and active restoration programs for abalone species in the region. For this study, abalone recruitment and sea urchin populations were surveyed in artificial habitats (16-22 m) across a spatial and temporal climatic gradient in southern California from 2010 to 2017 to inform the development of climate-ready abalone restoration programs. The SCB encompasses warm and cool islands, and experienced two periods of ocean conditions - cool (2010-2013) and warm ocean conditions (2014-2016). Dive surveys of the artificial habitats revealed that juvenile abalone recruitment remained low during the study period, suggesting that recovery is slow. Warm-water years favored recruitment of juvenile pink (Haliotis corrugata) and green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), with the highest abalone recruitment observed at Catalina Island. Endangered white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) were not observed despite placing the artificial habitats in suitable deep rocky reefs, which is further evidence supporting their endangered species status. The coolest site, San Diego, had little abalone recruitment, with a few juvenile red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and threaded (Haliotis kamtschatkana) abalone present. Sea urchin abundance and diversity increased during the warm period, with the largest increase at Catalina Island. During the warm period, Coronado sea urchin (Centrostephanus coronatus) increased in abundance, coincident with a decrease in the commercially valuable temperate red sea urchin (Mesocentrotus franciscanus). Potential shifts in the sea urchin assemblage to warm-water sea urchins may negatively impact recovering abalone populations and the red sea urchin fishery. Climate-ready abalone restoration will require ecosystem-based monitoring, tracking on not only abalone recruitment but also sea urchins, algal abundances, ocean temperature, and kelp forest communities as climate change may lead to complex and unexpected ecosystem interactions. © 2019 Journal of Shellfish Research.

AB  - Invasive plants have major impacts on forest ecosystems. Where invasive species alter successional pathways, a site may reach an alternate stable state in which compositional change is unlikely without management intervention. We conducted a restoration experiment designed to alter the successional factors of site availability, species availability, and species performance to disrupt the stable state of invader dominance. In a field dominated by invasive reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), we compared two plot preparation methods (late-season site mulching plus Oust® application, vs. late-season Rodeo® application) to increase site availability and reduce Phalaris performance, and planted native trees and shrubs as seeds and as bare root seedlings at three densities to improve native species availability. We monitored Phalaris growth, other herbaceous species establishment, tree survival, and deer browsing (another influence on species performance) for two growing seasons. Although the mulching plus Oust treatment was initially more successful in terms of its ability to increase site availability (as measured by litter percent cover and depth), this pattern reversed in the second year of the experiment. Throughout the experiment, the Rodeo treatment was superior in terms of its ability to decrease Phalaris performance (as measured by cover and height), and in the second year it also improved the performance of herbaceous plants naturally establishing in the plots (as measured by cover). Volunteer herbaceous plant cover averaged 60% in Rodeo-treated plots by the end of the second growing season. The performance of planted, seeded, and naturally-occurring woody plants was similar across the two herbicide treatments. Overall survival of bare root seedlings was 41%; survival was greater than 70% for both swamp white oak and Dutch elm disease-resistant American elm. Deer preferentially browsed on silver maple seedlings, while demonstrating avoidance of American elm, cottonwood, sandbar willow and swamp white oak. Our results suggest that to promote succession in Phalaris-dominated sites, decreasing Phalaris performance is more important than immediately removing thatch. In terms of species availability, we conclude that propagule limitation was occurring for woody plants but not for herbaceous species; natural tree recruitment was very low, so our alteration of tree species availability was critical in terms of promoting succession to floodplain forest. The restoration approach of stimulating natural succession can be applied to other ecosystems, providing a link between successional theory and management practice. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An invasive fungal pathogen has reduced the American chestnut (Castanea dentata), once a keystone tree species within its natural range in the eastern United States and Canada, to functional extinction. To help restore this important canopy tree, blight-tolerant American chestnut trees have been developed using an oxalate oxidase-encoding gene from wheat. This enzyme breaks down oxalate, which is produced by the pathogen and forms killing cankers. Expressing oxalate oxidase results in blight tolerance, where the tree and the fungus can coexist, which is a more evolutionarily stable relationship than direct pathogen resistance. Genetic engineering (GE) typically makes a very small change in the tree’s genome, potentially avoiding incompatible gene interactions that have been detected in some chestnut hybrids. The GE American chestnut also retains all the wild American chestnut’s alleles for habitat adaptation, which are important for a forest ecosystem restoration program. © 2019 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved;.

AB  - Restoration of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) is underway using backcross breeding that confers chestnut blight disease resistance from Asian chestnuts (most often Castanea mollissima) to the susceptible host. Successful restoration will depend on blight resistance and performance of hybrid seedlings, which can be impacted by below-ground fungal communities. We compared fungal communities in roots and rhizospheres (rhizobiomes) of nursery-grown, 1-year-old chestnut seedlings from different genetic families of American chestnut, Chinese chestnut, and hybrids from backcross breeding generations as well as those present in the nursery soil. We specifically focused on the ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi that may facilitate host performance in the nursery and aid in seedling establishment after outplanting. Seedling rhizobiomes and nursery soil communities were distinct and seedlings recruited heterogeneous communities from shared nursery soil. The rhizobiomes included EcM fungi as well as endophytes, putative pathogens, and likely saprobes, but their relative proportions varied widely within and among the chestnut families. Notably, hybrid seedlings that hosted few EcM fungi hosted a large proportion of potential pathogens and endophytes, with possible consequences in outplanting success. Our data show that chestnut seedlings recruit divergent rhizobiomes and depart nurseries with communities that may facilitate or compromise the seedling performance in the field. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mangrove forests in North Sumatera existed in the east coast of Sumatera Island and are rapidly degraded due to anthropogenic activities such as mangrove conversion to other land-uses. The present study describes one-year assessment on mangrove rehabilitation in Lubuk Kertang village, Langkat, North Sumatra, Indonesia. The restoration was carried on May 2016 using indirect planting of 6,000 Rhizophora apiculata seedlings. R. apiculata belongs to Rhizophoraceace family with hardwoods, have good stilt roots that can survive in mud substrate. The assessment was carried out in 4 plots with each plot consist of 100 plants. The evaluation parameters of mangrove reforestation comprise of seedling growth rate, diameter and height, leaf thickness and some leaves. Results show that the growth rate for first-year assessment was 92.3 % considered successful because of the average percent growth of plants ≥ 70 %. By contrast, the height, diameter, and a number of leaves seedlings planting were shown variation performance of among the plots observed. Our present study suggested that success factors in the rehabilitation of mangrove affected by salinity, substrate conditions, pests and diseases and human activities on the rehabilitation site. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Specifically, this book features detailed information about tomato production, water supply and cork production compiled in three different chapters. Beside these fundamental topics covered in this book, important insights concerning uses of biological processes i.e. bioremediation are also provided. In total, five chapters are grouped into three sections namely: agriculture, water supply and vegetation as it is reflected in the book title. The first chapter provides a comprehensive and accessible overview of the production of one of the most important horticultural crops in the country: tomato. Nowadays and worldwide, there is a trend towards alternative agriculture. To meet the growing demand, many viable options need to be explored, and one of these is the use of seaweed extracts. The second chapter is provided to show the significance of "algae-bacterium" combination in the restoration of plant growth under heavy metal stress.The last chapter, sealing the first section, focuses exclusively on general knowledge highlighting the significance and potential use in the near future of plant extracts as natural fertilizers and for the control of plant diseases. In the second section, the editors included a unique chapter dealing with water resources to address the lack of comprehensive and unified data. Indeed, this chapter is an ideal resource for study and reference on water input and output issues covering irrigation, groundwater, river basins The central message of the last section is quite relevant from an economic and social point of view, especially when the editors consider the contribution of forests and woodlands to national economy through production of cork, though neglected, is quite considerable. Editors collected data on this remarkable tree species taking into account some conservation and economic values to sound the alarm that, in near future, production of cork will not be viable anymore if there is no serious revision of existing policies. The book will be of interest to various audience targets: horticulture students, lecturers and local policymaker's as well environmental and agricultural officials. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Anti-TNF agents have been in the first line of treatment of various inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn’s Disease, with a number of different biologics being currently in use. A detailed analysis of their effect at transcriptome level has nevertheless been lacking. We herein present a concise analysis of an extended transcriptomics profiling of four different anti-TNF biologics upon treatment of the established hTNFTg (Tg197) mouse model of spontaneous inflammatory polyarthritis. We implement a series of computational analyses that include clustering of differentially expressed genes, functional analysis and random forest classification. Taking advantage of our detailed sample structure, we devise metrics of treatment efficiency that take into account changes in gene expression compared to both the healthy and the diseased state. Our results suggest considerable variability in the capacity of different biologics to modulate gene expression that can be attributed to treatment-specific functional pathways and differential preferences to restore over-or under-expressed genes. Early intervention appears to manage inflammation in a more efficient way but is accompanied by increased effects on a number of genes that are seemingly unrelated to the disease. Administration at an early stage is also lacking in capacity to restore healthy expression levels of under-expressed genes. We record quantifiable differences among anti-TNF biologics in their efficiency to modulate over-expressed genes related to immune and inflammatory pathways. More importantly, we find a subset of the tested substances to have quantitative advantages in addressing deregulation of under-expressed genes involved in pathways related to known RA comorbidities. Our study shows the potential of transcriptomic analyses to identify comprehensive and distinct treatment-specific gene signatures combining disease-related and unrelated genes and proposes a generalized framework for the assessment of drug efficacy, the search of biosimilars and the evaluation of the efficacy of TNF small molecule inhibitors. © 2019 Karagianni et al.

AB  - Type II diabetes (T2D) nephropathy, a major cause of end-stage kidney disease, progresses and develops from oxidative stress. Natural polyphenols can protect the kidney from diabetic nephropathy exerting antioxidant activities. The present approach enumerates the reno-protective and anti-apoptotic effects of mangosteen vinegar rind (MVR, a phenolic aqueous extract) against high-fat diet (5 g/day up to five weeks)-/streptozotocin (single ip, dose 30 mg/kgBW)-induced T2D nephropathy of albino mice. In vitro total phenolic content, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) activity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant capacity, and α-amylase inhibition activity as antidiabetic assay of MVR were performed. In vivo mice body weight, oral glucose, and maltose tolerance test, metabolic parameters (plasma glucose, insulin level, omeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance), biochemical parameters (kidney hypertrophy, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine), oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase) were estimated in an intervention study. Additionally, renal morphology and early apoptosis were observed following the H & E staining and TUNEL assay of the tissue frozen section. We found that the aqueous extract of MVR possesses potent in vitro antioxidative and antidiabetic activities. Animal intervention results showed that MVR 100, 200 mg/kgBW, and Glibenclamide 60 mg/kgBW treatments significantly improved (P < 0.05) the abovementioned parameters compared to the diabetic control group. Furthermore, treatments also significantly restored (P < 0.05) kidney histological alterations and reduced cellular apoptosis compared to the diabetic control group. These findings concluded that MVR treatments significantly modulated the glucose intolerance, metabolic alterations, and oxidative stress-induced pathological alterations and cellular apoptosis of diabetic kidney. Practical Application: Garcinia mangostana, a polyphenol rich natural product, is obtained from the tropical rain forest area of Southeast Asian countries and processes diverse biological activities including antioxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and so on. This research first time focuses on the nephro-protective and anti-apoptotic effects of mangosteen vinegar rind (MVR) from the mangosteen fruit pericarp. Our study provides the efficient data to prove the beneficial effect of MVR as a dietary supplement for the prevention and management of diabetic nephropathy. © 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®

AB  - Oak wilt disease and deer browsing have depleted the canopy and forest floor of secondary Quercus serrata and Quercus variabilis forests in Japan. Small-scale clear-cuttings enhance sprouting, and are, therefore, recommended for restoration of the damaged forests. However, most damaged forests are composed of mature stands, and it is not clear whether they would sprout successfully when cut. Moreover, little is known about the regeneration of forests damaged by both oak wilt disease and deer browsing. To determine the appropriate treatment for restoration of damaged Q. serrata and Q. variabilis forests, we established a study site with three different treatments (10 × 30 m each) in Kyoto City: clear-cut and fenced, removed dead oak trees and fenced, and removed dead oak trees and unfenced. After 1-year treatment, the number of species and individual saplings tended to increase at the lower slope of each treatment site with dominance of Ilex pedunculosa. The largest species and individual numbers were observed at the clear-cut fenced site, where pioneer species such as Mallotus japonicus were found. A few seedlings of Q. serrata were found at each treatment site, and no Q. variabilis was recorded. The emergence of Q. serrata seedlings was explained by their location at the slope and not by the treatment. Moreover, many sprouts of Q. serrata and Q. variabilis were observed at the clear-cut fenced site. Although further monitoring is needed, clear-cutting and fencing appear to be an effective method for the rehabilitation of depleted forests. © 2019, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering.

AB  - Previous research has mainly dealt with the physiological and psychological restorative effects of the forest environment. However, comparatively few studies have focused on how the traits and attributes of individuals (individual traits) affect the restorative effects of the forest environment. In this study, we examined the relationships between the psychological restorative effects offered by perceived restorativeness of outdoor settings and the individual traits. Then, we investigated the relationships between the restorative indicators that are useful in examining the restorative properties (i.e., the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS); seven indicators in total), the psychological restorative effect (Profile of Mood States (POMS), Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS), positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS), and Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS); 10 indicators in total), and the individual trait indicators that could be used to investigate individual traits (Development of Health and Life Habit Inventory for lifestyle, Lazarus-type Stress Coping Inventory for stress coping, World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment 26 for quality of life (QOL), and Sukemune-Hiew Resilience test for resilience; 28 indicators in total) in forest and urban settings. Respondents consisted of 46 male students in their twenties. A short-term experiment was conducted using the same method in both environmental settings. We then analyzed the intrinsic restorative properties and the restorative effects of the settings and referred to prior research to determine the restorative effects. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between the restorative indicators and the individual trait indicators by correlation analysis and multiple regression (step-wise) analysis. These new findings were obtained: (1) the forest setting was a restorative environment with a higher restorative effect than the urban setting; (2) although the forest setting had a higher restorative effect than the urban setting, and the influence of individual traits was small; (3) in the forest setting, the relationship between the restorative indicators and individual traits indicators were arranged; (4) distancing (Stress coping), psychological health (QOL), and satisfaction with living environment (QOL) were likely important indicators that are related to the restorative effects in the forest setting. © 2019 by the authors.

Image quality and precision is the center variables of this exploration. Regression model with autonomous parts in which the element esteems are dealt with as covariates. Adjusted Filtration of Gabor is associated with filtration process here for while the Laplace is associated with make the filtration system additionally convincing. The Filtration of Gabor is an immediate filter which drive response is portrayed by a consonant limit copied by a Gaussian limit. Threshold based stochastic regression model for segmentation is an immediate scan procedure broadly utilized for tackling streamlining issues based on the estimations of the target work when the subordinate information is obscure. Random forest model has been used for the classification of lung image dataset. This procedure is chiefly used to separate the anomalous part from the ordered info lungs image. The trial results demonstrate the separated irregular part of the info images. Copyright © 2019 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasive pests and pathogens have contributed to widescale forest change around the world, but especially in the eastern US. Phytophthora cinnamomi, one such introduced pathogen, causes root rot in American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), among other eastern forest species of interest, and has inhibited chestnut restoration efforts in some cases. Traditionally, P. cinnamomi has been associated with low landscape positions and moister soils; however, its distribution patterns in the eastern US are poorly understood. Improved understanding of P. cinnamomi distribution may enable forest managers to prioritize sites with low risk of P. cinnamomi presence for chestnut restoration. To elucidate landscape factors associated with P. cinnamomi distribution, two sets of soil samples from an eastern Kentucky forest (representing two levels of sampling intensity) were screened for P. cinnamomi incidence, and data were analyzed for spatial distribution patterns. In general, sites in which P. cinnamomi was detected tended to be warmer (higher annual solar radiation) and drier (lower moisture indices), than sites in which P. cinnamomi were not detected. P. cinnamomi incidence was also found to be associated with oak (Quercus spp.) abundance and (weakly) negatively associated with soil microbial activity under certain conditions. Overall, P. cinnamomi was found to be distributed across a wide range of landscape variables, including both drier ridge-top sites and moister streamside sites, contrary to traditional associations. In addition, the association with oak abundance suggests that the drier upland sites preferred by oak species in eastern Kentucky are not “safe” from P. cinnamomi. Given that P. cinnamomi was found distributed across a range of environmental conditions, forest managers cannot assume that any landscape position is phytophthora-free, and soil screening should be used for site selection to inform restoration of chestnut and other susceptible species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Elms (Ulmus spp.) were once dominant trees in mixed broadleaf forests of many European territories, mainly distributed near rivers and streams or on floodplains. Since ancient times they have provided important services to humans, and several selected genotypes have been massively propagated and planted. Today elm populations are severely degraded due to the negative impact of human-induced changes in riparian ecosystems and the emergence of the highly aggressive Dutch elm disease pathogens. Despite the death of most large elm specimens, there is no evidence of genetic diversity loss in elm populations, probably due to their ability to resprout after disease. The recovery of elm populations from the remaining diversity should build from genomic tools that facilitate achievement of resistant elm clones. Research works to date have discerned the genetic diversity of elms and are well on the way to deciphering the genetic clues of elm resistance and pathogen virulence, key findings for addressing recovery of elm populations. Several tolerant clones suitable for use in urban and landscape planting have been obtained through traditional species hybridization with Asian elms, and various native clones have been selected and used in pilot forest restoration projects. Successful reintroduction of elms should also rely on a deeper understanding of elm ecology, in particular their resilience to abiotic and biotic disturbances. However, all these efforts would be in vain without the final acceptance of elm reintroduction by the social actors involved, making it necessary to evaluate and publicize the ecosystem services elms can provide for today’s society. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - While the Chinese Grain for Green (GFG) policy has reduced the area of cultivated land in several regions in China, the program's effects on Per Unit Area Productivity of Cultivated Land (PAPCL) are not clear. As the positive or negative contributions of GFG to PAPCL can vary with context, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the correlations between the program and crop yields in order to determine the best balance between environmental benefits and food security. In this study, Wuqi County in China's Shaanxi Province was selected for a case study. Multi-source data were integrated in the Geographic Information System platform, and geographical weighted regression was then performed to spatially analyze the effects of the GFG on the improvement of PAPCL (GoP); with GoP as the dependent variable, we further analyzed the role of environmental variables in promoting the contribution of GFG to the improvement of PAPCL. Our findings are as follows: (1) GFG can better contribute to the PAPCL improvement in the villages with higher elevation, poor infrastructure, and denser populations, and thus, GFG could be further implemented in these areas. (2) In the area where GFG performed well, agricultural machinery and agricultural chemicals can be utilized less frequently, as they have similar effects on the improvement of PAPCL, but the increase of forest-based diseases and insect pests is possible. (3) The intensity of the GFG itself is negative compared to the GoP, which indicates that the implementation of the GFG in the study area may be excessive in improving the PAPCL. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The loss of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) in eastern North America to chestnut blight, a disease caused by the fungal pathogen (Cryphonectria parasitica), has devastated ecological and utilitarian processes and functions. A backcross breeding approach has been developed to confer disease resistance to hybrid seedlings, and forest reintroduction trials will provide important information on performance and durability of resistance in real-world forest conditions. Three plantings were established in 2009 in mesic, even-aged regeneration harvests (site index averaged 23 m for Quercus rubra) and were examined for eight-year blight resistance. These plantings are the first forest field trials to test blight resistance of the most advanced breeding generation currently available, the third generation of the third backcross (BC3F3), against less advanced breeding generations (BC1F3, BC2F3), disease-resistant Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima), and disease-susceptible American chestnut. We also examined if C. parasitica infection was related to tree size and growth. The pathogen infected 36 percent of trees across locations by year 8, but 31 percent of trees died prior to detection of infection. Non-pathogen related mortality was probably due to factors that are typical of hardwood plantings, including repeated deer browsing and native and non-native pest damage. The BC3F3 generation exhibited resistance more similar to the Chinese chestnut than the American chestnut, but exhibited significantly lower resistance than Chinese chestnut at the location with the highest blight incidence; genetic family differences among BC3F3 progeny were significant at this location. Interactions between planting location and breeding generation affected resistance rankings, suggesting additional or longer-term testing is needed to determine resistance of a particular breeding line across a variety of sites. Probability of disease incidence was positively related to ground-line diameter (GLD), but this relationship depended on location and breeding type. At two locations, American chestnut had 50 percent probability of C. parasitica infection when GLD was approximately 70 mm, and the BC3F3 had 50 percent probability when GLD was between 93 and 126 mm. The Chinese chestnut maintained low probability of disease incidence (&lt;35 percent) across all GLD sizes, regardless of location. While a relatively high level of disease resistance was associated with the most advanced breeding generation, BC3F3, the plantings are too young to determine durable blight resistance. © 2018

AB  - The number of global initiatives for forest restoration, and the scope of these initiatives, continues to increase. An important tool for meeting objectives of these global initiatives is reforestation, achieved by natural processes or by tree planting. Worldwide, organizations are challenged to most efficiently and effectively direct resources to the most critical reforestation needs. Currently in the United States, the reforestation efforts of the Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, are challenged by changes in policy, funding, climate change, and mega-fires, to name a few, and identifying strategies for timely successful reforestation at scale is needed. A 2016 conference brought together reforestation experts from across North America to discuss potential benefits of reforestation activities in the face of mounting challenges from invasive species, wildfires, diseases, and climate change. As a result of that effort, here we provide background on the challenges confronting successful reforestation on lands managed by the Forest Service, and describe the six manuscripts in this special issue and their foci: barriers to natural regeneration, when to actively plant trees or not to ensure a heterogeneous landscape, ecological and economic concerns when reforestation is delayed, employing traditional and novel silvicultural techniques in support of reforestation, leveraging reforestation to improve resilience of species affected by introduced pests, and the potential carbon sequestration benefits of a robust reforestation program. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The restoration of vegetation and soils on open pit mines has been comparatively analyzed for the third decade of self-restored (endoecogenesis) and managed (forest recultivation) successions. The study materials are located in the Usinsk region of the Komi Republic in the far north taiga subzone (near-tundra area). The results include 52 geobotanical descriptions at sites of 100 m2, as well as information on the occurrence and the partial activity of species. The cultures of Pinus sylvestris and Picea obovata have been examined; the agrochemical analysis of soils and grounds has been done. The forest recultivation forms tree layer of Va quality class coniferous species. The conservation degree is 0-60%, density - 0-3 thousand units/ha. The death causes normally are unfavorable substrate properties (poor or low-moisture substrate, contrast temperature regime) or fungal diseases like pine-leaf cast. Ground cover is dominated by typical technogenic species. We observe the appearance of newly formed species with a differentiated organic-accumulative horizon. Though forest cultures are marked through a low environment-forming role in first decade after planting, we evidence the increase in species abundance of phytocenoses and in cenotic activity of invader species, as well as intensive soil formation processes at the forest recultivation sites in contrast with the self-restored sites. The importance of pine and spruce planting is vivid through an unsatisfactory (less than 0.2 thousand units/ha) self-restoration of conifers on sandy and sandy loam pit mines of the near-tundra zone. © 2019.

AB  - Land degradation has become one of the major environmental issues that threaten the well-being of the world's 3.2 billion people. In recent years, it has received extensive attention from the United Nations (UN), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and so on. However, existing land degradation studies still suffer by unclear concepts, ambiguous processes and mechanisms, and incomplete understanding of impacts. Thus, clarifying the process and mechanism of land degradation is the key to preventing further land degradation and restoring degraded land. Based on the thematic assessment of the IPBES, the present study reviewed the concept, process, mechanisms as well as impacts of land degradation. The process of land degradation is driven by two factors: the natural environment and anthropogenic activities. In land degradation process, there are six land degradation states; namely, the appearance of degradation, degraded in the past, susceptible to degradation, land recovers when stressors are removed, temporal trend of increase in degradation, and stable degraded state. Land degradation can be divided into urban land degradation, cropland degradation, forest and grassland degradation, wetland degradation, and other types of land degradation based on land use types. Land degradation can threaten food and water security, reduce biodiversity and ecosystem services, trigger regional conflicts, mass migration, and disease transmission, exacerbate poverty and global climate change. The review of the land degradation process, mechanism, and impacts will provide theoretical guidance for in-depth study of land degradation, such as desertification and rocky desertification in China, and provide decision support for overall planning of governance of the mountain, water, forest, cropland, lake, and grass systems, supporting the construction of a Beautiful China and Eco-civilization. © 2019 Science Press.

AB  - The American quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and its close relative, the Eurasian quaking aspen (Populus tremula L.), cover a realm that is perhaps the most expansive of all tree species in the world. In North America, sudden aspen decline (SAD) is a growing concern that marks the rapid decline of quaking aspen trees leading to mortality at the stand and landscape scale. Research suggests that drought and water stress are the primary causes of SAD. Predisposing factors (age, structure, and landscape position), as well as associated stressors (i.e., pests and pathogens), have been linked to mortality in affected stands. The conflation of multiple interacting factors across the aspen's broad geographic range in North America has produced significant debate over the classification of SAD as a disease and the proper management of affected stands. Interestingly, no such effects have been reported for the Eurasian aspen. We here review and synthesize the growing body of literature for North America and suggest that SAD is a novel decline disease resulting from multiple inciting and interacting factors related to climate, land-use history, and successional dynamics. We suggest that the range of aspen observed at the onset of the 21st Century was bolstered by a wet period in western North America that coincided with widespread regional cutting and clearing of late-successional forests for timber and grazing. No comparable land-use history, successional status, or age-class structure is apparent or linked for Eurasian forests. Eurasian aspen is either absent or young in managed forests, or old and decadent in parks in Fenno-Scandinavia, or it grows more intimately with a more diverse mixture of tree species that have arisen from a longer period of frequent timber cutting in Russia. Based on these insights we provide recommendations for practical management techniques that can promote stand resilience and recovery across a range of stand conditions in North America. Managers should attempt to identify SAD-prone stands using the presence of predisposing conditions and focus treatments such as coppice or prescribed fire on stands with suitable topographies, elevations, and climates. We conclude that SAD will persist throughout the coming decades, given the enormity of past cutting history, fire exclusion, and current changes in climate until a more active restoration agenda is implemented. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In today’s modern society, lifestyle-related diseases play an increasingly important role as the cause of bad health. Staying in and access to environments that contain natural elements such as forests, parks and gardens has been featured because of its potential to stimulating people’s health and well-being. An independent research area has developed, which addresses issues that try to explain and document the health effects of access to and activities in nature. To bring together European researchers working with different aspects of the relation between nature and health, COST Action E39 “Forests, Trees, and Human Health and Wellbeing” was established in 2004 and terminated in November 2009. The main results of COST E39 was presented in the book “Forests, Trees and Human Health” published in 2011. This article focuses on three central research questions regarding the relationship between nature and health: (1) Nature’s restorative and salutogenic effects on human beings, (2) Health effects of outdoor physical activities, and (3) Therapeutic interventions such as therapy gardens and forest bathing. Based on a systematic review of research carried out in the aftermath of the COST Action the following conclusions are made: (1) There is a remarkable amount of research publications showing a statistical correlation between access to nature and green areas and human physical activity and health. However, there are few studies that really prove a causal relationship, i.e. that access to green areas leads to increased physical activity and better health. (2) The existing research on outdoor activities in natural environments describes a number of positive associations and effects on health, and the evidence for some of these are convincing, albeit there must be reservations for the immediate applicability of the conclusions. (3) A lot of studies also show that nature-based therapeutic interventions work and provide clear positive effects, but there is serious criticism about the quality of the studies. Finally, the authors suggest more emphasis on research regarding the economic benefits of nature’s health effects, more research on the effects of nature-based therapeutic interventions, and of broadening the theoretical basis. Furthermore, we foresee a better integration with health policies and practical implementation within urban planning and forest management. © S.F.S.P.. Tous droits réservés pour tous pays.

AB  - We conducted this assessment to provide information on the current conditions of riparian and wetland ecosystems in reference to their natural range of variability on the Manti-La Sal National Forest during forest plan revision. We used peer-reviewed literature, data from the Forest and other partners, and site visits to evaluate the status of four key ecosystem characteristics: (1) distribution of riparian ecosystems, (2) groundwater and surface water fluctuations, (3) channel and bank stability, and (4) floodplain condition. We determined that riparian and wetland ecosystems of the National Forest have experienced many stressors that have influenced their current conditions, including livestock and wild ungulate grazing, altered flow and fire regimes, road construction, timber harvest, invasive and encroaching species, vegetation mortality due to insects and disease, and altered temperature and precipitation regimes. Some geographical units of the Forest, particularly the Abajo Mountains, Mesas, and Canyons, appear to be more resistant to stressors. Our results have been incorporated in the assessment completed during the Forest plan revision process and will continue to be useful to resource managers and planners during efforts to restore and/or maintain riparian and wetland ecosystems on the Manti-La Sal National Forest. © 2019, USDA Forest Service.

AB  - The gut microbiome plays an important role in immune function and has been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, how and if the modulation of microbiota can prevent or treat MS remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (L. reuteri) ameliorated the development of murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used animal model of MS, a model which is primarily mediated by TH17 and TH1 cells. We discovered that L. reuteri treatment reduced TH1/TH17 cells and their associated cytokines IFN-γ/IL-17 in EAE mice. We also showed that the loss of diversity of gut microbiota induced by EAE was largely restored by L. reuteri treatment. Taxonomy-based analysis of gut microbiota showed that three “beneficial” genera Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Lactobacillus were negatively correlated with EAE clinical severity, whereas the genera Anaeroplasma, Rikenellaceae, and Clostridium were positively correlated with disease severity. Notably, L. reuteri treatment coordinately altered the relative abundance of these EAE-associated taxa. In conclusion, probiotic L. reuteri changed gut microbiota to modulate immune responses in EAE, making it a novel candidate in future studies to modify the severity of MS.

AB  - In this study, we present classification and regression analysis to predict the UPDRS score and its enhancement after the microelectrode STN signal recording (MER) with DBS surgery (implantation of the microelectrode). We hypothesized that a data informed grouping of features extrapolated from MER signals of STN can envisage restore (by decreasing the tremor) and functioning the motor improvement in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. A random—forest is used to account for unbalanced datasets and multiple observations per PD subject, and showed that only five features of STN-MER signals are sufficient and account for prognosting UPDRS advancement. This finding suggests that STN signal characteristics are maximum correlated to the extent of improvement motor restoration and motor behavior observed in STN DBS. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB  - Natural and urban forests worldwide are increasingly threatened by global change resulting from human-mediated factors, including invasions by lethal exotic pathogens. Ash dieback (ADB), incited by the alien invasive fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, has caused large-scale population decline of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) across Europe, and is threatening to functionally extirpate this tree species. Genetically controlled host resistance is a key element to ensure European ash survival and to restore this keystone species where it has been decimated. We know that a low proportion of the natural population of European ash expresses heritable, quantitative resistance that is stable across environments. To exploit this resource for breeding and restoration efforts, tools that allow for effective and efficient, rapid identification and deployment of superior genotypes are now sorely needed. Here we show that Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of phenolic extracts from uninfected bark tissue, coupled with a model based on soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA), can robustly discriminate between ADB-resistant and susceptible European ash. The model was validated with populations of European ash grown across six European countries. Our work demonstrates that this approach can efficiently advance the effort to save such fundamental forest resource in Europe and elsewhere. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The influences of human and physical factors on species invasions have been extensively examined by ecologists across many regions. However, how habitat fragmentation per se may affect forest insect and disease invasion has not been well studied, especially the related patterns over regional or subcontinental scales. Here, using national survey data on forest pest richness and fragmentation data across United States forest ecosystems, we examine how forest fragmentation and edge types (neighboring land cover) may affect pest richness at the county level. Our results show that habitat fragmentation and edge types both affected pest richness. In general, specialist insects and pathogens were more sensitive to fragmentation and edge types than generalists, while pathogens were much less sensitive to fragmentation and edge types than insect pests. Most importantly, the developed land edge type contributed the most to the richness of nonnative insects and diseases, whether measured by the combination of all pest species or by separate guilds or species groups (i.e., generalists vs. specialists, insects vs. pathogens). This observation may largely reflect anthropogenic effects, including propagule pressure associated with human activities. These results shed new insights into the patterns of forest pest invasions, and it may have significant implications for forest restoration and management. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Medicinal plants have been used by the people of Gorontalo as a hereditary tradition. But this knowledge has not spread to the wider community because the traditional wisdom about medicinal plants has not been documented, stored and managed properly by employing digital tools. The purpose of this study is to prepare an inventory of the traditional medicinal plants and the details of their uses in Atinggola, North Gorontalo district, Indonesia. Data has been collected by ethnobotanical survey method and analyzed using the descriptive qualitative method. The study has shown that 38 species of medicinal plants, belonging to 20 families, are used to cure many diseases by the traditional healers of Atinggola. Among them, 6 species are used to treat fever, 5 species to treat skin diseases, 2 species each to treat cancer, gastrointestinal diseases, liver diseases, and as body tonic to restore power; 1 species each to treat toothache, malaria, tonsillitis, allergies, eye irritation, wound infections and tuberculosis (TBC). Plant parts used in the treatment practices are leaf, fruit, flower, rhizome, root, stem, seed, shoots, midribs parts, etc. However, the most dominant part used is the leaf of the plants. Various methods such as boiling, squeezing, scraping, chewing, smashing, brewing, etc. are used to prepare the medicines. 29 species (76.31%) of medicinal plants are collected from cultivated sources such as backyards and gardens while 9 species (23.68%) are still sourced from forests. © 2018, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Forest densification, wildfires, and disease can reduce the growth and survival of hardwood trees that are important for biological and cultural diversity within the Pacific Northwest of USA. Large, full-crowned hardwoods that produce fruit and that form large cavities used by wildlife were sustained by frequent, low-severity fires prior to Euro-American colonization. Shifts in fire regimes and other threats could be causing declines in, large hardwood trees. To better understand whether and where such declines might be occurring, we evaluated recent trends in Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from 1991-2016 in California and southern Oregon. We included plots that lay within areas of frequent fire regimes during pre-colonial times and potential forest habitats for fisher, a rare mammal that depends on large live hardwoods. We analyzed changes in basal area for eight hardwood species, both overall and within size classes, over three time periods within ecoregions, and in public and private land ownerships. We found the basal area to generally be stable or increasing for these species. However, data for California black oak suggested a slight decline in basal area overall, and among both very large trees and understory trees; that decline was associated with fire mortality on national forest lands. In addition, mature trees with full crowns appeared to sharply decline across all species. Many trends were not statistically significant due to high variation, especially since more precise data from remeasured trees were only available for the two most recent time periods. Continued analysis of these indicators using remeasured trees will help to evaluate whether conservation efforts are sustaining large, full-crowned trees and their associated benefits. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Mediterranean gorgonian forests are species-rich habitats, and like many other marine habitats they are threatened by anthropogenic disturbances and mass mortality events. These mortality events have often been linked to anomalies in the temperature profiles of the Medi - terranean region. On 5 September 2017, colonies of the gorgonians Eunicella singularis and Eunicella cavolini exhibited rapid tissue loss, down to a depth of 30 m along the steep cliffs of Montecristo Island, Tuscan Archipelago National Park, Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy. Interestingly, Montecristo has previously been identified as a reference site for the ecological quality assessment of the western Mediterranean benthic assemblages on rocky bottoms. The observed mortality event oc - curred during a period of increased sea temperature. By utilising a combination of high-resolution oceanographic analysis, forecast models and citizen science initiatives, we propose that an early warning system for the concomitance of heat waves and mortality events can be put in place. A temperature-based coral disease surveillance tool could then be established for the entire Mediterranean Sea. Such a tool would allow for the timely study of mass mortality phenomena and the implementation of prompt mitigation and/or restoration initiatives. Finally, this specific mortality event, in a Marine Protected Area, offers a unique opportunity to monitor and assess the resilience of gorgonian populations and associated benthic assemblages in the absence of other, more directly, anthropogenic disturbances such as pollution and land runoff. © The authors 2018.

AB  - Previous studies used pictures or movies to investigate the impact of virtual nature environments on physiological and psychological health, providing inferior immersive experiences. The latest virtual reality (VR), launched in 2016, allows users to be fully immersed in simulated surroundings. However, the effects of the simulated environments created by the latest VR technology on health were not yet known. This study employed both cross-over and pretest-posttest design to examine the influence of forest and urban VR environments on restoration (N = 30). Both physiological and psychological responses were collected. The results show that participants’ systolic blood pressure and heart rate decreased with time, regardless of environmental differences. About psychological responses, an increased level of fatigue and a decreased level of self-esteem were reported in simulated urban environments. In contrast, an increased level of vigor and a decreased level of negative emotions (i.e., confusion, fatigue, anger-hostility, tension, and depression) were observed in simulated forest environments. In sum, greater benefits were found when immersing in forest settings. The latest VR technology can serve as an alternative way to access nature environments for restoration. © 2018

AB  - Moist, mixed conifer (MMC) forests, which encompass more than 11 million ha in the Inland Northwest, USA and adjacent Canada, were extensively modified after Euro-american occupation by now-outdated forestry practices and wildfire suppression. Those activities homogenized tree composition and density, modified forest soils, increased risks to insect and disease epidemics, and, in combination with longer drought periods ultimately increased the prevalence of unusually severe wildfires to further homogenize landscapes. Recommendations for restoring structure and function include re-establishing natural fire regimes and disturbance-patch size distributions across landscapes, as well as restoring and maintaining large, old early-seral dominant trees (LOEST), large snags and coarse woody debris, while accounting for physiographic influences. Implementing such recommendations with sensitivity to wildlife conservation requires additional details to account for habitat needs at the planning levels of national forests and districts. We synthesized silviculture-specific literature for wildlife species of greatest conservation concern listed in the strategic wildlife conservation plans of Inland Northwest states (“strategy” species), others of social and economic importance (“focal” species), and some others that are either important in the ecologies of strategy species or otherwise offer literature having particular relevance to MMC silviculture (“facilitative” species). Evaluations of habitat selection behavior and comparisons of species-specific habitat values to tree-stocking guidelines used by silviculturists indicated that most species reviewed are likely to respond positively to restoration, and that a wide array of extant silvicultural methods can be used, provided that large snags and acceptable levels of coarse woody debris are recruited or retained. Thinning followed by routine prescribed burning will be problematic for some wildlife species. Knowledge of wildlife responses to variation in the size distribution of disturbance patches is limited, as is knowledge of wildlife population responses to intentional forestry. Coupling new wildlife research to forest modeling and manipulative experiments within adaptive management and monitoring frameworks will improve predictions of wildlife population responses over the long time frames and multiple spatial scales associated with strategic planning. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) is one of the most important conifer species across eastern North America. However, emerging health issues of eastern white pine have increased dramatically in recent decades, raising serious concerns over the health and future of this species. These emerging issues are due to native pests and pathogens that were mostly innocuous in the past and hence, have been rarely studied. One fungal pathogen of concern, Caliciopsis pinea Peck, is associated with severe resinosis, crown thinning, dieback, cankers, and bark cracks/fissures. Reports of C. pinea have been on the rise since the mid-1990s, particularly in the northeastern U.S. An insect of concern, eastern white pine bast scale (Matsucoccus macrocicatrices Richards), is a sap-sucking pest associated with branch flagging, dieback, and canker formation. Although described as early as 1958, this insect was not reported in the southeastern U.S. until 2006, when it was found on eastern white pine with dieback symptoms. A foliar complex of fungal pathogens has also been on the rise since 2006 in the northeastern U.S. and southern Canada, known collectively as White Pine Needle Damage. This complex results in needle discoloration and necrosis, premature needle drop, and branch dieback. In combination, these emerging health issues are occurring at levels not previously reported and across several regions, indicating an imminent range-wide health concern for eastern white pine. Our goal is to synthesize the ecology, evolutionary and post-settlement history, silvicultural practices, and abiotic and biotic stressors of eastern white pine. By unifying the known ecology and stressors of eastern white pine, we aim to provide a forest health framework to assist resource managers in developing a cohesive conservation, management, and restoration plan for this critical conifer species in North America. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Eastern white pine (EWP), Pinus strobus L., is an iconic forest tree in the north woods of eastern North America. White pine blister rust, caused by Cronartium ribicola, an invasive pathogen, entered North America in the early 20th century and infected all five-needled pines across the continent. Few genotypes of eastern white pine have demonstrated consistent, elevated resistance to the pathogen, so our objective was to identify additional genotypes with resistance. Since 1970, the USDA Forest Service has identified and grafted over 800 phenotypic plus tree selections from Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. A protocol to artificially inoculate one-year old seedlings was used to screen 228 genotypes along with rust-resistant and susceptible standards across a four-year period, from 2010 to 2013. We identified 25 genotypes, based on survival assessed two years after inoculation, which exceeded the resistant standard. These genotypes will be grafted into new seed orchards to aid reforestation efforts aimed at restoring this keystone species to suitable habitats where regeneration is currently hindered by blister rust on privately-held land, state forests and national forests in the Lake States region. © 2018

AB  - In order to fully appreciate the role that fire, both natural and anthropogenic, had in shaping pre-Euro-American settlement landscapes in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), it is necessary to develop a more robust method of evaluating paleofire reconstructions. Here we demonstrate an approach that includes the identification of charcoal morphotypes (i.e. visually distinct charcoal particles), and incorporates both paleoecological and archaeological data sets, to more specifically determine both the nature of past fire regimes (i.e. fuel type and fire severity) and the likely ignition source of those fires. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by reconstructing the late Holocene fire and vegetation histories of Lake Oswego (Clackamas County), Oregon, and Fish Lake (Okanogan County), Washington, using macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis of sediment cores. The histories were compared with climatic records from the PNW as well as archaeological, ethnographic, and historical records from the Lower Columbia River Valley and Southern Columbia Plateau cultural regions. Our results indicate that while centennial-to-millennial-scale climate change had limited influence on the fire regimes at the study sites during the past ∼3800 years, the use of fire by Native Americans for a variety of reasons, particularly after ca. 1200 calendar years before present (AD 750), had a far greater impact. Charcoal morphotype ratios also indicate that fires in the two watersheds were fundamentally different in their severity and impact, and led to major shifts in the forests and woodlands surrounding Lake Oswego, but helped maintain the ponderosa pine-dominated forest at Fish Lake. The elimination of fire from the two study sites during the past 100–300 years is likely the combined result of Euro-American contact and the arrival of disease in the PNW, as well as 20th-century fire suppression and grazing effects on fuel continuity, which has implications for future forest management and restoration efforts in the PNW. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Forest managers are beginning to experiment with assisted migration (AM), the intentional movement of organisms to areas outside their historic range, as a pre-emptive adaptation to climate change. To date, AM studies have focused on species conservation, while AM in forestry has received little attention. Using Manitoba, Canada, as our study area, we developed a two-stage framework to evaluate North American tree species as AM candidates. Little’s (1971) range maps were used to characterize climatic ranges for 87 species, and GCM projections under RCP8.5 estimated potential future tree distributions for 2011–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100. Traits for the resulting 26 candidate species were evaluated in eight categories, each divided into several response factors, to investigate management potential, adaptation and interspecific interactions, vulnerability to pests, diseases and natural disturbance, and range of soil conditions tolerated. Multivariate analyses were used to classify species into groups characterized by different combinations of management potential, tolerance for climate extremes, and relative vulnerability to disturbances, insects, and disease. These groupings could be used by managers in a variety of applications—commercial forestry, urban forests, or restoration—as an initial selection filter for AM candidates. Separate uncertainty scores in each category should allow users to independently judge the quality of information contributing to a given category. Although our framework was regionally focused, it could be readily adapted to selecting AM candidates elsewhere. We recommend that the framework be further field tested among different practitioners, modifying, editing, and adding to the list of categories and factors, as needed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

In winter, these bats hibernate in caves and are experiencing overwinter mortalities due to infection from the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes white-nose syndrome (WNS). Population recovery of WNS-affected species is constrained by the ability of survivors to locate habitats suitable for rearing pups in summer. Forests in eastern North America have been severely altered by deforestation, land-use change, fragmentation and inadvertent introduction of exotic insect pests, resulting in shifts in tree distributions and loss of large-diameter canopy-dominant trees. This paper explores patterns in use of tree roosts by species of Myotis across Canada and the United States using meta-data from published sources. Myotis in western Canada, the Northwest, and Southwest selected the largest diameter roost trees and also supported the largest maximum exit counts. Myotis lucifugus, M. septentrionalis and M. sodalis, three species that inhabit eastern forests and which are currently experiencing region-wide mortalities because of WNS, selected roosts with the smallest average diameters. Recovery efforts for bark- and cavity-roosting Myotis in eastern North American forests could benefit from management that provides for large-diameter trees that offer more temporally-stable structures for roosting during the summer maternity season. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - Aim: The goal of the present investigation was to identify site-level factors that might allow prognostication of individual implants in partially dentate patients with multiple non-splinted restorations. Methods: We analysed clinical and radiographic characteristics of 222 non-splinted single implants in function for at least 5 years in 86 partially dentate individuals at the time of functional loading and at follow-up, with the outcome variable being peri-implantitis. Principal component analysis identified factors contributing to greatest variability and linear discriminant analysis coupled with Random Forest Classifier used to identify risk predictors. Results: After controlling for patient-level factors, the following characteristics were associated with significantly increased risk for peri-implantitis: Periodontal disease on adjoining teeth at the time of restoration (Odds Ratio (OR): 8.0), implant placement at a depth of 6 mm or more in relation to the CEJ of adjacent tooth (OR: 8.5), asymmetric prosthesis (OR: 4.3), history of tooth loss due to periodontitis (OR: 2.4) and a mean baseline plaque index of 1.6 or more (OR: 7.9). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a system that incorporates both subject level and implant-level factors is required to effectively prognosticate the success of individual implants. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Appalachian forests are threatened by a number of factors, especially introduced pests and pathogens. Among these is Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne oomycete pathogen known to cause root rot in American chestnut, shortleaf pine, and other native tree species. This study was initiated to characterize the incidence of P. cinnamomi on surface mined lands in eastern Kentucky, USA, representing a range of time since reclamation (10, 12, 15, and 20 years since reclamation). Incidence of P. cinnamomi was correlated to soil properties including overall soil development, as indicated by a variety of measured soil physical and chemical parameters, especially the accumulation of soil organic carbon. P. cinnamomi was detected in only two of the four sites studied, aged 15 and 20 years since reclamation. These sites were generally characterized by higher organic matter accumulation than the younger sites in which P. cinnamomi was not detected. These results demonstrate that P. cinnamomi is capable of colonizing reclaimed mine sites in Appalachia; additional research is necessary to determine the impact of P. cinnamomi on susceptible tree species at these sites. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Whitebark pine forests are declining due to infection by white pine blister rust and mountain pine beetle, combined with the effects of climate change and fire suppression. The Canadian Rocky and Columbia Mountains represent a large portion of the whitebark range; a vast area, exemplifying the need for knowledge about whitebark pine stands to target restoration. The aim of our work was to identify variables predicting live tree infection, seedling infection, canopy kill, mortality, and regeneration across this region, and present the results in spatially-explicit formats to assist land managers with restoration. Live tree and seedling infection by white pine blister rust increased over the last decade and cascading effects of the disease are intensifying, including canopy kill and mortality. We show that large diameter trees are more likely to be infected, and the highest infection rates are in southern and western areas. The conditions for seedling infection are more strongly influenced by fine-scale climatic conditions than for trees. Areas with low regeneration are: (1) the dry east slopes where live tree infection is low; and (2) where live tree infection rates are high, suggesting that canopy kill and mortality are influencing regeneration. Results highlight where to target restoration and coordinate across boundaries. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Phytophthora cinnamomi is a soil-borne plant pathogen of global significance, threatening many forest tree species around the world. In contrast to other well-known tree pathogens, P. cinnamomi is a generalist pathogen that, in many cases, causes less immediately obvious symptoms, making P. cinnamomi more difficult to diagnose. This creates special challenges for those trying to assess and manage diseases caused by P. cinnanmomi. P. cinnamomi affects a wide range of tree species across the world including chestnuts, particularly American and European chestnuts, Eucalyptus and Banksia species in Australia, and oaks in Mediterranean Europe. We believe that forest professionals should incorporate an understanding of the diseases caused by P. cinnamomi in conservation, management, and restoration of threatened ecosystems dominated by P. cinnamomi-affected tree species. Here we review the impact of P. cinnamomi on forest ecosystems internationally and suggest three major strategies for improving forest resilience to P. cinnamomi: (1) Improving site quality to reduce risk of P. cinnamomi-related disease, (2) Genetically improving threatened species to improve resistance to P. cinnamomi, and (3) Restricting further spread (especially by nursery trade) of P. cinnamomi. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Traditional knowledge on ethnomedicinal plant is slowly eroding. The exploration, identification and documentation on utilization of ethnobotanic resources are essential for restoration and preservation of ethnomedicinal knowledge about the plants and conservation of these species for greater interest of human society. Methods: The study was conducted at fringe areas of Chilapatta Reserve Forest in the foothills of the eastern sub-Himalayan mountain belts of West Bengal, India, from December 2014 to May 2016. Purposive sampling method was used for selection of area. From this area which is inhabited by aboriginal community of Indo-Mongoloid origin, 400 respondents including traditional medicinal practitioners were selected randomly for personal interview schedule through open-ended questionnaire. The questionnaire covered aspects like plant species used as ethnomedicines, plant parts used, procedure for dosage and therapy. Results: A total number of 140 ethnomedicinal species was documented, in which the tree species (55) dominated the lists followed by herbs (39) and shrubs (30). Among these total planted species used for ethnomedicinal purposes, 52 species were planted, 62 species growing wild or collected from the forest for use and 26 species were both wild and planted. The present study documented 61 more planted species as compared to 17 planted species documented in an ethnomedicinal study a decade ago. The documented species were used to treat 58 human diseases/ailments including nine species used to eight diseases/ailments of domestic animals. Stomach-related problems were treated by maximum number of plants (40 species) followed by cuts and wounds with 27 plant species and least with one species each for 17 diseases or ailments. Maximum number of 12 diseases/ailments was cured by Melia azedarach followed by Centella asiatica and Rauvolfia serpentina which were used to cure 11 diseases/ailments each. Conclusions: The list of 140 plant species indicates that the Chilapatta Reserve Forest and its fringe areas are rich in biodiversity of ethnobotanical plant species. Rauvolfia serpentina were the most valuable species in terms of its maximal use with higher use value. The documentation of 78 species maintained in the home gardens indicates the community consciousness on the conservation values of these ethnobotanical species. The communities should be encouraged with improved cultivation techniques of commercially viable ethnobotanical species through capacity building, timely policy intervention along with strong market linkage. This will ensure income generation and livelihood improvement and ultimate conservation of these species. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The tick Ixodes ricinus has considerable impact on the health of humans and other terrestrial animals because it transmits several tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) such as B. burgdorferi (sensu lato), which causes Lyme borreliosis (LB). Small forest patches of agricultural landscapes provide many ecosystem services and also the disservice of LB risk. Biotic interactions and environmental filtering shape tick host communities distinctively between specific regions of Europe, which makes evaluating the dilution effect hypothesis and its influence across various scales challenging. Latitude, macroclimate, landscape and habitat properties drive both hosts and ticks and are comparable metrics across Europe. Therefore, we instead assess these environmental drivers as indicators and determine their respective roles for the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in I. ricinus. Methods: We sampled I. ricinus and measured environmental properties of macroclimate, landscape and habitat quality of forest patches in agricultural landscapes along a European macroclimatic gradient. We used linear mixed models to determine significant drivers and their relative importance for nymphal and adult B. burgdorferi prevalence. We suggest a new prevalence index, which is pool-size independent. Results: During summer months, our prevalence index varied between 0 and 0.4 per forest patch, indicating a low to moderate disservice. Habitat properties exerted a fourfold larger influence on B. burgdorferi prevalence than macroclimate and landscape properties combined. Increasingly available ecotone habitat of focal forest patches diluted and edge density at landscape scale amplified B. burgdorferi prevalence. Indicators of habitat attractiveness for tick hosts (food resources and shelter) were the most important predictors within habitat patches. More diverse and abundant macro- and microhabitat had a diluting effect, as it presumably diversifies the niches for tick-hosts and decreases the probability of contact between ticks and their hosts and hence the transmission likelihood. Conclusions: Diluting effects of more diverse habitat patches would pose another reason to maintain or restore high biodiversity in forest patches of rural landscapes. We suggest classifying habitat patches by their regulating services as dilution and amplification habitat, which predominantly either decrease or increase B. burgdorferi prevalence at local and landscape scale and hence LB risk. Particular emphasis on promoting LB-diluting properties should be put on the management of those habitats that are frequently used by humans. In the light of these findings, climate change may be of little concern for LB risk at local scales, but this should be evaluated further. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Dutch elm disease was detected nearly a hundred years ago in north-eastern France. Since then it has spread extensively to the point that it is considered to be one of the most destructive diseases ever found on woody plants, both in Europe and in north America. Other diseases have proved to be just as destructive such as chestnut blight once again in Europe and north America, or potentially just as damaging such as ash dieback in Europe. It therefore appeared worthwhile to try to learn some lessons from one of the oldest pandemics affecting a forest tree species. In actual fact, two pandemics of Dutch elm disease in succession were involved, attributed to two distinct fungi (Ophiostoma ulmi and then O. novo-ulmi) that developed in Europe. O. novoulmi, which at the end of the 1960s was responsible for the most severe pandemic, experienced rapid evolutionary changes via hybridization and horizontal gene transfers with other species. The aggressiveness of this fungus appears not to have subsided in the last fifty years and the amount of growing elm stock in French forests has diminished considerably but appears to have stabilized in the last ten years at between 2 and 4 million cubic metres, with young stems predominant according to data from the national Forest Inventory. Mortality in forests also appears to be relatively low, perhaps in connection with the drop in the population of its main vector (Scolytus scolytus), which is mainly reliant on adult tees. In spite of the drastic drop in elm populations, there is no study that shows any decrease in the genetic diversity of field populations in Europe. However, the introduction of an Asian species of elm that is resistant to Dutch elm disease in southern Europe has led, after hybridization and introgression, to irreversible changes in the genetic structures of native elms. In this area, human actions in the wake of the disease may have altered the genetic structure of elm populations more than the disease itself. Similarly, the effects of the two successive pandemics on the biodiversity associated with elms appear to be fairly limited according to the literature. These results are at odds with the alarmist view that predominated in the 1980s and which led to establishing a repository for elm genetic resources in the form of a collection of clones in the hopes of breeding resistant elms. No clone was found to be strongly resistant to Dutch elm disease but some of them, amongst those that were more prone to heal, could contribute to restoring hedgerows. In the 1990s, in situ conservation facilities for European white elm and mountain elm stands were set up in the framework of a network coordinated at the European level. © AgroParisTech, 2018.

AB  - Plant and fungal interactions drive successional trajectories within reforestation offering both mutualisms (ectomycorrhizal fungi [ECM]) and fungal pathogens. Appalachian forest and mine reclamation projects re-introducing American chestnut and chestnut hybrids will inevitably document the return of chestnut blight, resulting in cankers causing branch dieback and loss of photosynthetic tissue. Similar to herbivory, the loss of photosynthetic tissue may reduce ECM root colonization and cause changes in fungal species composition. To test this, 75 six-year-old established chestnut trees were selected to represent the following: (1) Healthy trees free of chestnut blight; (2) trees with cankers and 50% branch dieback; (3) trees that died prior to the fifth growing season. Each tree had a chestnut seed planted 24 cm from the base. ECM colonization of both the established parent trees (n = 50) and five-month-old seedlings (n = 64) were quantified and genera determined by fungal DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed (ITS) region. Healthier seven-year-old chestnuts trees had significantly more ECM roots than those trees infected with chestnut blight cankers. However, disease die-back on chestnut did not have an influence on community composition among the parent trees or the neighboring five month seedlings. Results also demonstrated that five-month-old seedlings neighboring healthy parent trees had greater ECM on roots (P = 0.002), were larger in size (P = 0.04), and had greater survival (P = 0.01). ECM genera such as Cortinarius, Russula and Scleroderma provided tree to seedling inoculation. ECM colonization by Cortinarius spp. resulted in larger chestnut plants and increased nitrogen foliar concentrations on the five month seedlings. It can be hypothesized that blight will aid in diversifying forest stand composition and these early ECM networks will help facilitate the survival of other native hardwoods that recruit into these sites over time. © 2018 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - In today’s modern society, lifestyle-related diseases play an increasingly important role as the cause of bad health. Staying in and access to environments that contain natural elements such as forests, parks and gardens has been featured because of its potential to stimulating people’s health and well-being. An independent research area has developed, which addresses issues that try to explain and document the health effects of access to and activities in nature. To bring together European researchers working with different aspects of the relation between nature and health, COST Action E39 “Forests, Trees, and Human Health and Wellbeing” was established in 2004 and terminated in November 2009. The main results of COST E39 was presented in the book “Forests, Trees and Human Health” published in 2011. This article focuses on three central research questions regarding the relationship between nature and health: (1) Nature’s restorative and salutogenic effects on human beings, (2) Health effects of outdoor physical activities, and (3) Therapeutic interventions such as therapy gardens and forest bathing. Based on asystematic review ofresearch carried out in the aftermath of the COST Action the following conclusions are made: (1) There isaremarkable amount of research publications showing astatistical correlation between access to nature and green areas and human physical activity and health. However, there are few studies that really prove acausal relationship, i.e. that access to green areas leads to increased physical activity and better health. (2) The existing research on outdoor activities in natural environments describes anumber of positive associations and effects on health, and the evidence for some of these are convincing, albeit there must be reservations for the immediate applicability of the conclusions. (3) Alot of studies also show that nature-based therapeutic interventions work and provide clear positive effects, but there isserious criticism about the quality of the studies. Finally, the authors suggest more emphasis on research regarding the economic benefits of nature’s health effects, more research on the effects of nature-based therapeutic interventions, and of broadening the theoretical basis. Furthermore, we foresee abetter integration with health policies and practical implementation within urban planning and forest management. © AgroParisTech, 2018.

AB  - Ecosystem services are increasingly valued on federal lands, beyond just their economic value. Climate change effects will vary greatly within different subregions of the Northern Rockies, with some ecosystem services being affected in the short term and others in the long term. Of the many ecosystem services provided in the Northern Rockies, eight are considered here, including annual water yield, water quality, wood products, minerals and mineral extraction, forage for livestock, viewsheds and air quality, regulation of soil erosion, and carbon sequestration. Although annual water yield is not expected to change significantly, timing of water availability will likely shift, and summer flows may decline. These changes may result in some communities experiencing summer water shortages, although reservoir storage can provide some capacity. Rural agricultural communities will be disproportionately affected by climate change if water does become limiting. Water quality will also decrease in some locations if wildfires and floods increase, adding sediment to rivers and reservoirs. Hazardous fuel treatments, riparian restoration, and upgrading of hydrologic infrastructure can build resilience to disturbances that damage water quality. Forage for livestock is expected to increase in productive grasslands as a result of a longer growing season and in some cases elevated carbon dioxide. Therefore, ranching and grazing may benefit from climate change. Primary effects on grazing include loss of rural population, spread of nonnative grasses, and fragmentation of rangelands. Viewsheds and air quality will be negatively affected by increasing wildfires and longer pollen seasons. A growing percentage of the Northern Rockies population will be in demographic groups at risk for respiratory and other medical problems on days with poor air quality. Hazardous fuel treatments can help build resilience to disturbances that degrade air quality. Carbon sequestration will be increasingly difficult if wildfires, insect outbreaks, and perhaps plant disease increase as expected, especially in the western part of the Northern Rockies. At the same time, managing forests for carbon sequestration is likely to become more important in response to national policies on carbon emissions. Hazardous fuel treatments can help build resilience to disturbances that rapidly oxidize carbon and emit it to the atmosphere. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Satoyama landscape is expressed as vegetation mosaic composed of different successional stages, such as cropland, grassland, and pine and oak forests in different growth phase. The mosaic structure was dynamically sustained by use of natural resources with periodical cutting, under local rule for sharing resources without exhaustion. It is said, therefore, that Satoyama landscape represents people’s life harmonized with nature. The landscape, however, drastically changed due to the socioeconomic change of Japan, in relation to rapid economic growth from 1955 to 1975. Since people moved from rural to urban area for getting jobs in the period, wide area of Satoyama at urban fringe was developed to housing estate. Materials for daily life, such as domestic fuel, fertilizer for crops, timber, were changed from natural resources collected from Satoyama to those of chemical and/or imported ones. Disuse of natural resources allowed vegetation to progress natural succession, and caused a change of Satoyama landscape from mosaic into monotonous one, and then spread of pine and oak wilt diseases. Explosive increase in Shika deer population and extreme expansion of bamboo forests have seriously damaged to Satoyama ecosystems. These challenges represent change into people’s life disharmonized with nature. Activities for restoring and utilizing Satoyama have newly arisen in different regions. In urban and urban fringe areas, NPOs and other volunteers outside the area have formed theme community and taken a core role in improving supplying services of Satoyama ecosystems with getting cultural services. In the depopulating mountainous area with less volunteer power, social system for getting domestic energy and for circulating economy in the area has built to make an incentive of Satoyama restoration for community member, such as forest owners, forest owner’s cooperative and store managers, under a management of NPO. The trial is to improve supporting services by getting provisioning services from the Satoyama forest. In every region, NPO is the key not only for player but also for producer and manager of the activities. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2017.

AB  - Butternut trees dying from a canker disease were first reported in southwestern Wisconsin in 1967. Since then, the disease has caused extensive mortality of butternut throughout its North American range. The objectives of this study were to quantify changes in butternut populations and density across its range and identify habitat characteristics of sites where butternut is surviving in order to locate regions for potential butternut restoration. The natural range of butternut (Juglans cinerea L.) extends over a large region of eastern N. America encompassing New Brunswick south to North Carolina, north to Minnesota, and southwest to Missouri. Despite the species’ large range, it is typically not a common tree, comprising a relatively minor component of several different forest types. We evaluated change in butternut abundance and volume from current and historic data from 21 states in the eastern United States. We related abundance and volume at two time periods to a suite of ecological and site factors in order to characterize site conditions where butternut survived. We also assessed the current level of butternut mortality across its range. Since the 1980s, the number of butternut trees and butternut volume have decreased by 58% and 44%, respectively, across its US range. Substantial relative decreases in tree numbers and volume occurred in most ecoregion sections. Five environmental variables were found to be significant predictors of butternut presence. The potential impacts of butternut canker are particularly acute as the canker pathogen invasion pushes a rare tree species toward extinction, at least at a local scale. Based on the results presented here, large-diameter maple/beech/birch stands in dry, upland sites in eastern Minnesota, western Wisconsin, and upstate New York appear to offer the most favorable conditions for butternut growth and survival and thus may be the best stands for planting resistant butternut trees. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The ubiquitous growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and its medical applications has improved the effectiveness in remote health monitoring systems of elderly people or patients who need long-term personal care. Nowadays, chronic illnesses, such as, stroke, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases are major causes of death, in many parts of the world. In this paper, we propose a patient monitoring system for strokeaffected people to minimize future recurrence of the same by alarming the doctor and caretaker on variation in risk factors of stroke disease. Data analytics and decision-making, based on the real-time health parameters of the patient, helps the doctor in systematic diagnosis followed by tailored restorative treatment of the disease. The proposed model uses classification algorithms for the diagnosis and prediction. The ensemble method of treebased classification-Random Forest give an accuracy of 93%. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The terrestrial condition assessment (TCA) evaluates effects of uncharacteristic stressors and disturbance agents on land-type associations (LTAs) to identify restoration opportunities on national forest system (NFS) lands in the United States. A team of agency scientists and managers, representing a broad array of natural resource disciplines, developed a logic structure for the TCA to identify appropriate data sources to support analyses. Primary national data sources included observed insectand pathogen-induced mortality, key critical loads for soil and the atmosphere, long term seasonal departures in temperature and precipitation, road densities, uncharacteristic wildfires, historical fire regime departure, wildfire potential, insect and pathogen risk, and vegetation departure from natural range of variability. The TCA was implemented with the ecosystem management decision support (EMDS) system, a spatial decision support system for landscape analysis and planning. EMDS uses logic models to interpret data, synthesizes information over successive layers of logic topics, and draws inferences about the ecological integrity of LTAs as an initial step to identifying high priority LTAs for landscape restoration on NFS lands. Results from the analysis showed that about 74 percent of NFS lands had moderate or better overall ecological integrity. Major impacts to ecological integrity included risk of mortality due to insects and disease, extent of current mortality, extent of areas with high and very high wildfire hazard potential, uncharacteristically severe wildfire, and elevated temperatures. In the discussion, we consider implications for agency performance reporting on restoration activities, and subsequent possible steps, including strategic and tactical planning for restoration. The objective of the paper is to describe the TCA framework with results from a national scale application on NFS lands. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Tree species world-wide are under increasing threat from diseases and insects, many of which are non-native. The integrity of our natural, urban and plantation forest ecosystems, and the services they provide are seriously imperiled. Breeding programs that harness the natural genetic resistance within tree species can provide a durable solution to these threats. In many cases, genetic resistance offers the key to restoration of forests and may even prevent extinction of some tree species. The potential use of genetic resistance is often widely discussed, but the development of applied programs and use of resistant seed has only taken place in a relatively few species. The reflections here from some of the most advanced applied resistance programs, as well as some of the unknowns and limitations of implementing a resistance program will provide a guide to managers considering this approach. In any such program, there is a research component, a tree improvement component and a restoration and reforestation component. These three components, along with sustained management and public support, need to be linked for any genetic resistance program to be fully successful in facilitating the recovery of healthy forests. Other management activities and newly developing technologies may serve to complement genetic resistance or to expedite its development, but premature, over-emphasis on some of these may slow the operational program. An understanding of the level, frequency, durability and stability of resistance and its limitations are necessary to management planning. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG (outside the USA).

AB  - Surface mining and mine reclamation practices have caused significant forest loss and forest fragmentation in Appalachia. Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) is threatened by a variety of stresses, including diseases, pests, poor management, altered fire regimes, and climate change, and the species is the subject of a widescale restoration effort. Surface mines may present opportunity for shortleaf pine restoration; however, the survival and growth of shortleaf pine on these harsh sites has not been critically evaluated. This paper presents first-year survival and growth of native shortleaf pine planted on a reclaimed surface mine, compared to non-native loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), which has been highly successful in previous mined land reclamation plantings. Pine monoculture plots are also compared to pine-hardwood polyculture plots to evaluate effects of planting mix on tree growth and survival, as well as soil health. Initial survival of shortleaf pine is low (42%), but height growth is similar to that of loblolly pine. No differences in survival or growth were observed between monoculture and polyculture treatments. Additional surveys in coming years will address longer-term growth and survival patterns of these species, as well as changes to relevant soil health endpoints, such as soil carbon. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Ecological restoration of forests is largely favored by tree planting, often leaving out other important growth forms. Despite their relevant ecological roles, in restoration plantations, epiphytic richness rarely reaches values found in reference ecosystems. At the same time, epiphytes are wasted when forests are cleared for infrastructure projects, instead of being properly relocated. The goal of this study is to improve the knowledge for epiphytic relocation and enrichment, in restoration forests. We seek to answer the following questions: (i) Over a one year period, can six species of epiphytes survive, attach to phorophytes and reproduce, after being transplanted to host trees? (ii) Is epiphyte development after transplantation affected by species of phorophytes, bark roughness, canopy cover and position of transplantation? (iii) Is performance of relocated epiphytes species specific? For this purpose, 360 adult individuals of vascular epiphytes (Bromeliaceae, Cactaceae and Orchidaceae) were transplanted onto host trees located in two semi-deciduous seasonal forests in the Atlantic Forest of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Epiphytes achieved high survival rates after one year (55.2–100% of individuals) and all species presented structures for either sexual or asexual reproduction. Their overall development was enhanced when we carried out transplantations at the beginning of wet season and using sisal string to attach epiphytes and palm fiber to cover phorophyte's bark, which were relevant factors attributing to the success of transplantations. Species of phorophyte was not an attributing factor to the successful development of transplanted individuals, which only showed slight responses to conditions they provided. However, responses among epiphytes were species-specific, demonstrating the importance of studying their biology in order to successfully enrich restoration forests. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) are polycultures with at least one tree species. These systems provide various ecosystem services, income increments and food safety. These ecosystem services include biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, reduction of crop diseases, increased biological controls, biological nitrogen fixation and nutrient cycling. A review of potential ecosystem services of AFS on Southern Brazil is presented. In addition, the potential of carbon uptake through conversion to AFS is estimated. The predominant AFS are agroforestry with yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil.), silvopastures, citrus and banana orchards, and the palm acaí-jucara (Euterpe edulis Mart.). Considering the conversion of conventional systems to AFS, the silvopastures present the greatest carbon sequestration potentiality due to the great area used for cattle ranching. The conversion of citrus and banana cropping also present great carbon uptake potential besides reducing fungal and bacterial diseases. Southern Brazil presents more than 15 million hectares which could be converted into silvopasture and other AFS by taking as a model the already well-established experiences. Moreover, AFS has become a strategy for forest restoration. There are no negative trade-offs related to the silvopasture and citrus agroforestry adoption. The reasons for the low adoption of AFS are discussed.

AB  - Molecular breeding incorporates efficient tools to increase rust resistance in five-needle pines. Susceptibility of native five-needle pines to white pine blister rust (WPBR), caused by the non-native invasive fungus Cronartium ribicola (J.C. Fisch.), has significantly reduced wild populations of these conifers in North America. Major resistance (R) genes against specific avirulent pathotypes have been found in several five-needle pine species. In this study, we screened genic SNP markers by comparative transcriptome and genetic association analyses and constructed saturated linkage maps for the western white pine (Pinus monticola) R locus (Cr2). Phenotypic segregation was measured by a hypersensitive reaction (HR)-like response on the needles and disease symptoms of cankered stems post inoculation by the C. ribicola avcr2 race. SNP genotypes were determined by HRM- and TaqMan-based SNP genotyping. Saturated maps of the Cr2-linkage group (LG) were constructed in three seed families using a total of 34 SNP markers within 21 unique genes. Cr2 was consistently flanked by contig_2142 (encoding a ruvb-like protein) and contig_3772 (encoding a delta-fatty acid desaturase) across the three seed families. Cr2 was anchored to the Pinus consensus LG-1, which differs from LGs where other R loci of Pinus species were mapped. GO annotation identified a set of NBS-LRR and other resistance-related genes as R candidates in the Cr2 region. Association of one nonsynonymous SNP locus of an NBS-LRR gene with Cr2-mediated phenotypes provides a valuable tool for marker-assisted selection (MAS), which will shorten the breeding cycle of resistance screening and aid in the restoration of WPBR-disturbed forest ecosystems. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Gaining insight into the ability of tree populations to evolve pest, disease, and drought resistance is of major importance with regard to the conservation of adaptive tree genetic resource variation under global change. However, the longevity of tree species challenges accurate assessment of additive genetic variation driving trait evolution through common garden experiments and pedigree-informed quantitative genetic analyses. Here, we argue that recent developments in landscape and population genomics pave the way for molecular marker-based analysis of evolutionary potential as a more time and cost-efficient alternative. Focusing on phenotype- or ecology-informed molecular markers increases the per-marker contribution to the genetic variation underpinning phenotypic trait evolution. Considering that most tree species lack a reference genome, landscape genomic analysis of anonymous markers can be used in concert with in situ and ex situ phenotypic monitoring of tree populations to quantify tree adaptive potential. Global forest restoration efforts and strategies to conserve tree genetic resources are likely to benefit considerably from marker-based insights in the spatial distribution of tree adaptive genetic diversity. © 2017.

AB  - The exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) dominates vast acreages of rangeland in the western USA, leading to increased fire frequency and ecosystem degradation that is often irreversible. Episodic regeneration failure (“die-off”) has been observed in cheatgrass monocultures and can have negative ecosystem consequences, but can also provide an opportunity for restoration of native species and ecological function within the imperiled sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Proximate causes of cheatgrass die-off are uncertain, although several taxa of fungal soil pathogens have been implicated. Die-off occurrence is stochastic and can occur in remote areas. Thus, developing remote sensing indicators that are repeatable over long time periods, across extensive regions, and at relatively fine spatial resolution would be beneficial for accurately pinpointing events. We developed a remote sensing approach for mapping historical die-off from the Landsat archive (1985–2015), and used this to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of die-off occurrence annually at 30-m resolution. A Random Forests classification of image-derived spectral endmembers, trained on 2014 data, predicted die-off with 93% accuracy (κ = 0.845) when applied to independent validation data from 2009. Die-off extent varied greatly across years, though some areas experienced die-off multiple times during the observation period. We found a strong correspondence between die-off occurrence and winter drought conditions, with strongest negative associations with current-year winter precipitation and previous years’ lagged winter and annual precipitation. Die-off duration was heavily skewed towards single-year die-off (81.5% of events), even in localized areas of more frequent occurrence (‘die-off hotspots’). Our retrospective classification of the Landsat archive suggests that cheatgrass die-off occurrence is predictable as the intersection of particular site environmental conditions with annual weather conditions, possibly because they are favorable for disease expression. Associations with previous year conditions suggest that die-off may also depend upon feedbacks between cheatgrass dominance and litter production, suitable sites for seedling establishment, and abundance and persistence of pathogen inoculum. Remote sensing indicators such as those developed in this study are needed to develop hypotheses about die-off causal factors, as well as support improved management of cheatgrass, mitigation for negative consequences associated with die-off (e.g. wind erosion), and successful restoration of native plant communities on die-off areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Altitudinal movement by tropical birds to track seasonally variable resources can move them from protected areas to areas of increased vulnerability. In Hawaiʻi, historical reports suggest that many Hawaiian honeycreepers such as the ‘I‘iwi (Drepanis coccinea) once undertook seasonal migrations, but the existence of such movements today is unclear. Because Hawaiian honeycreepers are highly susceptible to avian malaria, currently minimal in high-elevation forests, understanding the degree to which honeycreepers visit lower elevation forests may be critical to predict the current impact of malaria on population dynamics and how susceptible bird populations may respond to climate change and mitigation scenarios. Using radio telemetry data, we demonstrate for the first time that a large fraction of breeding adult and juvenile ‘I‘iwi originating from an upper-elevation (1,920 m) population at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge exhibit post-breeding movements well below the upper elevational limit for mosquitoes. Bloom data suggest seasonal variation in floral resources is the primary driver of seasonal movement for ‘I‘iwi. To understand the demographic implications of such movement, we developed a spatial individual-based model calibrated using previously published and original data. ʻI‘iwi dynamics were simulated backward in time, to estimate population levels in the absence of avian malaria, and forward in time, to assess the impact of climate warming as well as two potential mitigation actions. Even in disease-free ‘refuge’ populations, we found that breeding densities failed to reach the estimated carrying capacity, suggesting the existence of a seasonal “migration load” as a result of travel to disease-prevalent areas. We predict that ‘I‘iwi may be on the verge of extinction in 2100, with the total number of pairs reaching only ~ 0.2–12.3% of the estimated pre-malaria density, based on an optimistic climate change scenario. The probability of extinction of ‘I‘iwi populations, as measured by population estimates for 2100, is strongly related to their estimated migration propensity. Long-term conservation strategies likely will require a multi-pronged response including a reduction of malaria threats, habitat restoration and continued landscape-level access to seasonally variable nectar resources. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - Cedar-broadleaf forests developed by Korean cedar (Pinus koraiensis Siebold et Zucc.) are the most ancient and most valuable forest formation of the Far East. More than half of these forests areas and reserves are located in Primorsky Krai, where multidimensional works are carried out during the past decades to restore its range and timber reserves. This is due to the fact that all parts of this relic species (needles, wood, cones, seeds, etc.) have different medicinal properties, which were well known to local people and were used to treat many diseases.

AB  - There has been an increased interest in tree breeding for resistance to exotic pests and pathogens, however relatively little research has focused on the reintroduction of these tree species. Understanding the durability of resistance in field settings and the field performance of improved trees is critical for successful species reintroduction. To evaluate methods for reintroducing American chestnut [Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh] to managed forests on the Cumberland Plateau, we quantified four-year survival and growth and three-year competitive ability of chestnut seedlings planted on the Daniel Boone National Forest in southeastern Kentucky, USA. We used a split-plot design to compare chestnut response among three silvicultural treatments spanning a gradient of light levels; midstory removal, thinning, and shelterwood with reserves (2, 24, and 65% available photosynthetically active radiation, respectively) and three chestnut breeding types; American, Chinese (C. mollissima Blume.), and BC2F3 hybrid. One of two hybrid families planted had similar survival to American chestnuts, 21 and 27% survival, respectively, while the other had better survival, 57%. Chinese chestnut survival was better than the other breeding generations (90%). High mortality among American and hybrid chestnut seedlings was likely caused by infection from Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands. Incidence of blight infection was low. While chestnut seedling growth was greatest in the high-light treatment, competitive ability of chestnut, evaluated by comparing planted seedling height to height of understory competitors, was maximized in the intermediate light treatment. These results demonstrate the importance of evaluating competition pressure from co-occurring vegetation and field performance of resistant genotypes when assessing methods for reintroducing tree species to forested settings. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of soil amendment applications on soil and the foliage nutrient status of a Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa Endlicher) plantation established following clear-cutting in a pine-wilt-disease (PWD)-disturbed forest. We established four soil amendment treatments [(compound fertilizer (CF), compound fertilizer + biochar (CFB), compound fertilizer + sawdust (CFS) and a non-treated control treatment] in an 8-year-old Japanese cypress plantation. Soil organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) between the soil amendment treatments and the control treatments, whereas extractable phosphorus (P), NH4 +, K+, and Mg2+ concentrations were significantly affected by the addition of biochar in CF. The mean soil CO2 efflux rates during the study period were the highest in CFB (0.79 g CO2 m−2 h−1), followed by CFS (0.71 g CO2 m−2 h−1), CF (0.62 g CO2 m−2 h−1), and the control (0.46 g CO2 m−2 h−1) treatments. Foliar N and P concentrations were significantly higher in the CFB than in the control treatments. The results suggest that the addition of biochar in CF can enhance extractable soil nutrients and foliar N and P conditions of Japanese cypress established in a PWD-disturbed forest. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was once a cultural, ecological, and economic staple of hardwood forests of the Eastern United States; however, chestnut blight caused by Cryphonectria parasitica has severely threatened its significance. The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) is a non-profit organization that has focused on backcross breeding as a means of restoring C. dentata to the wild. A major goal of this breeding program has been to introduce blight resistance from Chinese chestnut [Castanea mollissima ] while recovering “American chestnut” morphology by backcrossing with C. dentata. The Berry College backcross orchard, in northwest Georgia, was the first such orchard established by TACF with the goal of producing advanced hybrids derived from crosses with wild C. dentata from Georgia (part of TACF's state chapter program). In 2008, three lines of third backcross (BC3) hybrids were planted at the orchard along with F1, C. mollissima, and C. dentata controls. The theoretical model for the backcross breeding program predicts intermediate blight resistance, at best, in BC3 trees, along with an otherwise American chestnut morphology. This paper focuses on the degree to which this combination of desired traits has been found among the first lines of BC3 trees generated in Georgia. Trees were inoculated with blight in May 2013 (at age 4–5 yrs), and blight resistance was evaluated in October 2013 and March 2014 and used to calculate an average blight-susceptibility index (BSI). In September 2013, branch samples were collected and used to evaluate 20 leaf, stem, and bud traits known to differ consistently between C. mollissima and C. dentata. The average of standardized scores for morphological traits was used as an index of species identity (ISI) for each tree. On average, BC3 lines showed significant morphological differences when compared with Chinese chestnut lines, nesting morphologically with American chestnuts. Each BC3 line contained some trees with both intermediate blight resistance and morphological traits similar to C. dentata, supporting the prediction that both sets of traits have been advanced using the backcross methodology. These results are discussed in relationship to currently evolving understanding of the genetics of blight resistance and with respect to other traits needed for successful restoration in the southern United States. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Major declines of whitebark pine forests throughout western North America from the combined effects of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, fire exclusion policies, and the exotic disease white pine blister rust (WPBR) have spurred many restoration actions. However, projected future warming and drying may further exacerbate the species' decline and possibly compromise long-term success of today's restoration activities. We evaluated successes of restoration treatments under future climate using a comprehensive landscape simulation experiment. The spatially explicit, ecological process model FireBGCv2 was used to simulate whitebark pine populations on two U.S. Northern Rocky Mountain landscapes over 95 years under two climate, three restoration, and two fire management scenarios. Major findings were that (1) whitebark pine can remain on some high mountain landscapes in a future climate albeit at lower basal areas (50% decrease), (2) restoration efforts, such as thinning and prescribed burning, are vital to ensure future whitebark pine forests, and (3) climate change impacts on whitebark pine vary by local setting. Whitebark pine restoration efforts will mostly be successful in the future but only if future populations are somewhat resistant to WPBR. Results were used to develop general guidelines that address climate change impacts for planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating fine-scale restoration activities. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - With almost 1 million species, insects occupy most niches in terrestrial and freshwater habitats and are vital to the functioning of ecosystems. With so many species it is difficult to characterize how “insects” will be impacted by climate change. Some species will benefit while others will lose out as climate changes, and they cannot adapt or move across the landscape. To better understand climate change impacts this chapter explores three diverse assemblages of insects-(1) forest insect herbivores, (2) pollinators and other flower visitors, and (3) insects of freshwater ecosystems. Although there are research gaps in understanding climate change impacts and efficient adaptation options it is believed that providing high-quality habitat across the landscape through targeted habitat conservation, management, and restoration is needed to ameliorate the impacts of climate on vulnerable insect groups. Insects will need high-quality habitat, travel corridors, and stepping stone habitats (since some species can fly) to move across the landscape in search of new climate niches and habitats. Managers wishing to conserve insect habitat also need to reduce land-use stressors, such as pesticides, diseases, overgrazing, and invasive species. Insects are resilient and providing habitat for these small animals is often relatively easy compared to wide-ranging vertebrate species and by providing intact habitat patches, managers are providing the underpinning of the food chain that has myriad ecosystem benefits. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to study the correlation between land use/land cover changes and the disease. To explore which kinds of land type variation can influence the disease transmission. We used ENVI and ArcGIS technology and combined with the data correlation and the method of geospatial overlay analysis to do data processing and results analysis that are the three period remote sensing images which about 2001, 2011, 2006 in Maryland. Results showed that: time scale, the relationship between Lyme disease and forest wetland and pasture land was negative correlation, but it positively correlated with bare land, grassland and waters. Spatial scale, Lyme disease mainly distributes in the western and southern areas in Maryland. There is spatial correlation between the farmland, wetland and the waters. We concluded that through the spatial-temporal distribution: waters and wet grasslands provide are so good habitat for ticks that the probability of Lyme disease spreading is becoming large. By increasing the contact frequency between human beings and animals makes ticks are more likely to spread disease, thus increasing the incidence of Lyme disease. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) forests have been declining throughout their range in western North America from the combined effects of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, fire exclusion policies, and the exotic disease white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola). Projected warming and drying trends in climate may exacerbate this decline; however, whitebark pine has a wide climatic tolerance because of its broad distribution coupled with high genetic diversity. A rangewide whitebark pine restoration strategy (Keane et al. 2012b) was developed recently to inform restoration efforts for whitebark pine across Federal, State, and Provincial land management agencies. This strategy, however, did not address the effects of climate change on existing whitebark pine populations and restoration efforts. In this report, we present guidelines for restoring whitebark pine under future climates using the rangewide restoration strategy structure. The information to create the guidelines came from two sources: (1) a comprehensive review of the literature and (2) a modeling experiment that simulated various climate change, management, and fire exclusion scenarios. The general guidelines presented here are to be used with the rangewide strategy to address climate change impacts for planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating fine-scale restoration activities for whitebark pine by public land management agencies. © 2017, USDA Forest Service.

AB  - The state of, and changes to, altitudinal and polar treeline ecosystems and their services in selected mountain regions in Europe were analyzed using the drivers-pressures-stateimpacts- responses (DPSIR) framework. The analysis was based on 45 responses of experts from 19 countries to 2 semi-structured questionnaires on treeline ecosystem services (ESs), stakeholders and the DPSIR factors, and 11 case study descriptions of best management practices. The experts recognized climate and land-use changes as the main drivers, resulting in various pressures that contrasted among the regions. The impacts of the pressures were mainly considered as negative (e.g. loss of biodiversity, root rot diseases, moth and bark beetle outbreaks, wild fires, decrease of (sub)alpine grasslands, browsing), but also as positive (e.g. increase in forested area). The influence of climate warming, altered precipitation regimes, a longer growing season, annual variation in winter climate and increased ground-level ozone concentrations were considered less critical for recent treeline dynamics than land abandonment, increased tourism and livestock pressure. Current policy responses to emerging pressures and stakeholder demands were considered insufficient and incoherent. Mitigation, adaptation and restoration actions were rare and with no evident long-term impact. We conclude that (1) locally-specific human-environment interactions have greater influence on treeline dynamics than global warming; (2) ecological and social sustainability of the treeline areas can be enhanced by simultaneously promoting traditional land use and regulating tourism development; (3) ES users should look for new opportunities arising from environmental change rather than trying to sustain current levels of ESs indefinitely; and (4) to safeguard the unique ecological and social values of treeline areas, more coherent and proactive policies are needed. © The authors 2017.

AB  - Teak (Tectona grandis) occupies a significant place for reforestation in Cote d'Ivoire. Recently, there has been a resurgence of withering in different forestry areas, which represents a serious threat to the profitability and survival of forest plantations. A study has been undertaken to resolve this problem. Plant samples were collected from the trunk (bark, sapwood and central cylinder) and the roots for fungal microflora analysis through in vitro cultures to identify the causative agent of the decay of healthy trees. Sixteen different fungal genera were selected, including two species responsible for teak disease: Verticillium sp. with 82% and 98% frequencies and Fomes sp. with 79% and 60% frequencies, respectively in the roots and trunks of the diseased teaks. The presence of fungi was recorded as Verticillium sp. in 30% of diseased trees, Fomes sp. in 7.5% and all species combined in 70.5% of the cases. The inoculation of young seedling teaks in semi-controlled environment with isolates of different species of fungi allowed the restoration of the infection over 73.3% of the plants with Verticillium sp. and 16.4% with Fomes sp. The study recorded, for the first time, Verticillium sp. responsible for teak decay in plantation and reforestation (semi deciduous dense forest environment) in Cote d'Ivoire. Very often the causes of teak and forest species decay associated with fungi are attributed by error to Fomes sp., ignoring a formidable decay agent in forestry, the Verticillium sp. The lack of knowledge and information on the real causality of teak decay, associated with fungi, could make fungicidal treatments, for control of wood tree diseases, difficult and unsuccessful. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - Forest restoration often includes thinning to reduce tree density and improve ecosystem processes and function while also reducing the risk of wildfire or insect and disease outbreaks. However, one drawback of these restoration treatments is that slash is often burned in piles that may damage the soil and require further restoration activities. Pile burning is currently used on many forest sites as the preferred method for residue disposal because piles can be burned at various times of the year and are usually more controlled than broadcast burns. In many cases, fire can be beneficial to site conditions and soil properties, but slash piles, with a large concentration of wood, needles, forest floor, and sometimes mineral soil, can cause long-term damage. We describe several alternative methods for reducing nonmerchantable forest residues that will help remove excess woody biomass, minimize detrimental soil impacts, and create charcoal for improving soil organic matter and carbon sequestration. © 2017 Deborah S.

AB  - A soil resampling approach has detected an early stage of recovery in the cation chemistry of spruce forest soil due to reductions in acid deposition. That approach is limited by the lack of soil data and archived soil samples prior to major increases in acid deposition during the latter half of the 20th century. An alternative approach is the dendrochemical analysis of dated wood to detect temporal changes in base cations back into the 19th century. To infer environmental change from dendrochemical patterns of essential base cations, internal factors that affect cation chemistry such as the maturation of sapwood and the spread of wood infection need to be recognized. Potassium concentration was a useful marker of these internal maturation and infection that could affect the concentration of essential base cations in wood. Dendrochemical patterns in samples of red spruce in the eastern United States and Norway spruce in northwestern Russia were used to determine how internal changes in base cations can be separated from external changes in root-zone soil to date major changes in the availability of essential base cations associated with a changing environment. © 2017

AB  - Planting urban trees and expanding urban forest canopy cover are often considered key strategies for reducing climate change impacts in urban areas. However, urban trees and forests can also be vulnerable to climate change through shifts in tree habitat suitability, changes in pests and diseases, and changes in extreme weather events. We developed a three-step framework for urban forest vulnerability assessment and adaptation that scales from regional assessment to local on-the-ground action. We piloted this framework in the Chicago region in 10 locations representing an urban-exurban gradient across a range of socioeconomic capacities. The majority of trees across a seven-county region had low to moderate vulnerability, but many of the least vulnerable species were nonnative invasive species. Urban forests in the 10 pilot locations ranged in vulnerability largely due to differences in economic and organizational adaptive capacity. Adaptation actions selected in these locations tended to focus on increased biodiversity and restoration of natural disturbance regimes. However, adaptation actions in more developed sites also included incorporating new species or cultivars. Lessons learned from the pilot area can be used to inform future efforts in other urban areas. © 2016

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance Piper umbellatum L. (Piperaceae) is a shrub found in the Amazon, Savannah and Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is widely used in folk medicine in many countries primarily for the treatment of gastric disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastroprotective and anti-ulcer effects of hydroethanolic extract of P. umbellatum (HEPu) leaves in experimental rodents. In addition, the anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of the extract was assessed. Materials and methods The leaves of P. umbellatum were macerated in 75% (1:3 w/v) hydroethanolic solution to obtain HEPu. The gastroprotective and ulcer healing activities of HEPu were evaluated using acidified ethanol (acute) and acetic acid (chronic) gastric ulcer models in rodents. The anti-H. pylori activity was evaluated by in vitro broth microdilution assay using H. pylori cagA+ and vacA+ strain. The probable mechanism of action of HEPu was evaluated by determining gastric secretory parameters, antioxidant enzyme (catalase), non-protein sulfhydryl (glutathione) and malondialdehyde levels in gastric tissue, including pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, TNF-a, IL -17, RANTES, IFN-γ and MIP-2) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines. Results HEPu demonstrated potent gastroprotection against acute ulcer induced by acidified ethanol and excellent healing effect of the chronic ulcer induced by acetic acid. The gastroprotective activity in acidified ethanol is partly attributed to the antioxidant mechanisms, while anti-secretory, anti-inflammatory and regeneration of the gastric mucosa are evoked as part of its antiulcer mechanism of action. The gastric ulcer healing of HEPu also involves restoration of the altered cytokines levels to near normal. However, it has no in vitro anti-H. pylori activity. Conclusion The results of this study showed that HEPu possesses preventive and curative effects in experimental models of gastric ulcers in animals. These effects are partially dependent on antioxidant, antisecretory, anti-inflammatory and mucosa regeneration. It is independent of anti-H. pylori activity, with substances probably responsible for the pharmacological activity being flavonoids, quercetin and rutin. These results support the popular use of P. umbellatum leaves in the treatment of peptic ulcers. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

AB  - Research suggests that certain forest environments can contribute to lower stress levels in humans. This might be increasingly important to consider given the rising prevalence of stress-related diseases and illness absence. To make it feasible to plan for forest management strategies that take such restorative effects into account, it would seem to be important to identify the precise physical properties that contribute to the restorative qualities of forest stands. It would also be useful if forest stand data typically already collected by forest owners could be used for this purpose. In the present study, forest stands in northern, central, and southern Sweden were visited and assessed regarding their restorative potential. These assessments were analysed together with available forest stand data for each region using statistical models. Our results indicate that of the available forest stand data parameters, the most important individual indicators of forest stands’ restorative qualities were tree age, tree sparsity, and tree height. Models based on these parameters explained 30–40 % of the variation in restorative qualities among the evaluated stands, indicating that they can be useful in planning and modelling scenarios where restorative properties of forest stands are considered. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background: Demographic and clinical predictors of aphasia recovery have been identified in the literature. However, little attention has been devoted to identifying and distinguishing predictors of improvement for different outcomes, e.g., production of treated vs. untreated materials. These outcomes may rely on different mechanisms, and therefore be predicted by different variables. Furthermore, treatment features are not typically accounted for when studying predictors of aphasia recovery. This is partly due to the small numbers of cases reported in studies, but also to limitations of data analysis techniques usually employed. Method: We reviewed the literature on predictors of aphasia recovery, and conducted a meta-analysis of single-case studies designed to assess the efficacy of treatments for verb production. The contribution of demographic, clinical, and treatment-related variables was assessed by means of Random Forests (a machine-learning technique used in classification and regression). Two outcomes were investigated: production of treated (for 142 patients) and untreated verbs (for 166 patients). Results: Improved production of treated verbs was predicted by a three-way interaction of pre-treatment scores on tests for verb comprehension and word repetition, and the frequency of treatment sessions. Improvement in production of untreated verbs was predicted by an interaction including the use of morphological cues, presence of grammatical impairment, pre-treatment scores on a test for noun comprehension, and frequency of treatment sessions. Conclusion: Improvement in the production of treated verbs occurs frequently. It may depend on restoring access to and/or knowledge of lexeme representations, and requires relative sparing of semantic knowledge (as measured by verb comprehension) and phonological output abilities (including working memory, as measured by word repetition). Improvement in the production of untreated verbs has not been reported very often. It may depend on the nature of impaired language representations, and the type of knowledge engaged by treatment: it is more likely to occur where abstract features (semantic and/or grammatical) are damaged and treated. © 2016 de Aguiar, Bastiaanse and Miceli.

AB  - Phytophthora species are potent pathogens that can devastate terrestrial plants, causing billions of dollars of damage yearly to agricultural crops and harming fragile ecosystems worldwide. Yet, virtually nothing is known about the distribution and pathogenicity of their marine relatives. This is surprising, as marine plants form vital habitats in coastal zones worldwide (i.e. mangrove forests, salt marshes, seagrass beds), and disease may be an important bottleneck for the conservation and restoration of these rapidly declining ecosystems. We are the first to report on widespread infection of Phytophthora and Halophytophthora species on a common seagrass species, Zostera marina (eelgrass), across the northern Atlantic and Mediterranean. In addition, we tested the effects of Halophytophthora sp. Zostera and Phytophthora gemini on Z. marina seed germination in a full-factorial laboratory experiment under various environmental conditions. Results suggest that Phytophthora species are widespread as we found these oomycetes in eelgrass beds in six countries across the North Atlantic and Mediterranean. Infection by Halophytophthora sp. Zostera, P. gemini, or both, strongly affected sexual reproduction by reducing seed germination sixfold. Our findings have important implications for seagrass ecology, because these putative pathogens probably negatively affect ecosystem functioning, as well as current restoration and conservation efforts. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Caries risk assessment (CRA) is widely recommended for dental caries management. Little is known regarding how practitioners use individual CRA items to determine risk and which individual items independently predict clinical outcomes in children younger than 6 y. The objective of this study was to assess the relative importance of pediatric CRA items in dental providers’ decision making regarding patient risk and in association with clinically evident caries, crosssectionally and longitudinally. CRA information was abstracted retrospectively from electronic patient records of children initially aged 6 to 72 mo at a university pediatric dentistry clinic (n = 3,810 baseline; n = 1,315 with follow-up). The 17-item CRA form included caries risk indicators, caries protective items, and clinical indicators. Conditional random forests classification trees were implemented to identify and assign variable importance to CRA items independently associated with baseline high-risk designation, baseline evident tooth decay, and follow-up evident decay. Thirteen individual CRA items, including all clinical indicators and all but 1 risk indicator, were independently and statistically significantly associated with student/resident providers’ caries risk designation. Provider-assigned baseline risk category was strongly associated with follow-up decay, which increased from low (20.4%) to moderate (30.6%) to high/extreme risk patients (68.7%). Of baseline CRA items, before adjustment, 12 were associated with baseline decay and 7 with decay at follow-up; however, in the conditional random forests models, only the clinical indicators (evident decay, dental plaque, and recent restoration placement) and 1 risk indicator (frequent snacking) were independently and statistically significantly associated with future disease, for which baseline evident decay was the strongest predictor. In this predominantly high-risk population under caries-preventive care, more individual CRA items were independently associated with providers’ risk determination than with future caries status. These university dental providers considered many items in decision making regarding patient risk, suggesting that, in turn, these comprehensive CRA forms could also aid individualized care, linking risk assessment to disease management. Knowledge Transfer Statement: Caries risk assessment (CRA) is widely recommended for patienttailored, prevention-focused caries management. Studies show mixed predictive performance of pediatric CRA instruments, but little is known regarding how information captured in CRA forms guides clinical decision making. This study, in highcaries prevalence 6- to 72-mo-olds, demonstrates the following: 1) most items in a CRA instrument were independently associated with practitioners’ risk designations, 2) practitioners’ risk designations were significantly associated with future disease, and 3) of baseline measures associated with future caries, evident decay was the strongest independent indicator of future caries status. Although current disease (resulting from existing pathological and protective factor imbalance) may sufficiently predict future caries status in populations, other CRA items incorporated during risk categorization could aid practitioners to develop individualized intervention strategies against identified risk factors. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2016.

AB  - We used spatial optimization to analyze alternative restoration scenarios and quantify tradeoffs for a large, multifaceted restoration program to restore resiliency to forest landscapes in the western US. We specifically examined tradeoffs between provisional ecosystem services, fire protection, and the amelioration of key ecological stressors. The results revealed that attainment of multiple restoration objectives was constrained due to the joint spatial patterns of ecological conditions and socioeconomic values. We also found that current restoration projects are substantially suboptimal, perhaps the result of compromises in the collaborative planning process used by federal planners, or operational constraints on forest management activities. The juxtaposition of ecological settings with human values generated sharp tradeoffs, especially with respect to community wildfire protection versus generating revenue to support restoration and fire protection activities. The analysis and methods can be leveraged by ongoing restoration programs in many ways including: 1) integrated prioritization of restoration activities at multiple scales on public and adjoining private lands, 2) identification and mapping of conflicts between ecological restoration and socioeconomic objectives, 3) measuring the efficiency of ongoing restoration projects compared to the optimal production possibility frontier, 4) consideration of fire transmission among public and private land parcels as a prioritization metric, and 5) finding socially optimal regions along the production frontier as part of collaborative restoration planning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Invasive mammals have irreversibly altered ecosystems of Hawai'i and other tropical Pacific islands in numerous cases through novel herbivory, predation, and diseases, thereby causing the disproportionate extinction of flora and fauna that occur nowhere else on Earth. The control and eradication of invasive mammals is the single most expensive management activity necessary for restoring ecological integrity to many natural areas of Hawai'i and other Pacific Islands, and have already advanced the restoration of native biota by removing herbivorous ungulates from >750 km. Rodenticides which have been tested and registered for hand and aerial broadcast in Hawai'i have been used to eradicate rats from remote islands to protect nesting seabirds and are now being applied to larger islands to protect forest birds. The exclusion of other invasive mammals is now being undertaken with more sophisticated control techniques and fences. New fence designs are capable of excluding all mammals from areas to protect endangered native birds. Although the eradication of mammals from large areas has resulted in the restoration of some ecosystem processes such as natural forest regeneration, changes in other processes such as fire regimes, nutrient cycling, and invasive plant proliferation remain more difficult to reverse at larger landscape scales. © The Mammal Society of Japan.

AB  - Aleppo pine is a thermophilic species that has become a popular tree species in plantings even beyond its natural habitat. In 1999 the pathogenic fungus Gremmeniella abietina was isolated for the first time in Aleppo pine plantations in Spain. The main objective of this study was to analyse the variation in susceptibility to G. abietina (European race, biotype A) infections among trees from five Aleppo pine provenances. Artificial inoculations were performed at two different times in January 2012. The susceptibility of the trees was evaluated by recording disease severity and the length of internal stem necrosis produced by the pathogen. In addition, the concentrations of two flavanone compounds were quantified as putative indicators of resistance. Provenances and G. abietina isolates both significantly affected levels of necrosis although the results were dependent on the time of inoculation. There was a relationship between provenance and resistance, with trees of higher elevation provenances being more susceptible to disease than trees of lower elevation provenances. The amount of naringenin flavanone from trees was significantly different between provenances, suggesting that it is a possible indicator value for resistance. Conversely, no differences were found in the concentration of eriodictyol in trees between provenances. The results show that the provenance-dependent variation in the susceptibility of Aleppo pine to G. abietina should be considered in selection of seed sources for restoration. © 2016 British Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - Since the mid-twentieth century, under different management regimes (over 20 years of a wolf control program followed by 20 years of trophy hunting), wolves were absent or rare in Western Poland (hereinafter WPL). They became strictly protected in the whole country in 1998 and started to re-settle the vast forests of WPL, far (376 ± 106.5 km) from the source population in eastern Poland. In 2002–2012, the population increased from several to approximately 140 wolves living in 30 family groups, with an annual rate of increase of 38 % (λ = 1.38, SE = 0.10). The area of permanent occurrence increased from 600 to 10,900 km2, with an average density of 1.3 wolves/100 km2. The nearest neighbour distance between wolf territories decreased from 260 to 25 km. In 2001–2005, half of the settlement efforts by wolves failed after 1–2 years whereas in 2006–2009 only one fifth of newly settled wolves failed to persist &gt;2 years. The number of wolves in groups varied from 2 to 9, and the mean group size increased from 1.8 in 2001 to 4.8 in 2012. The survival of pups from May to the end of November was 50 % (the mean number of pups per litter was 5.1 and 2.5, respectively). Of 28 wolves found dead, 65 % were killed by vehicles, 25 % were poached, and 7 % died because of diseases and natural factors. All road casualties were young wolves, most of them male (67 %), hit on roads on average 11.6 km from the centre of the nearest pack. The re-colonisation of WPL started from jump dispersal, which allowed wolves to establish packs in distant locations. As the recovery proceeded, the dispersal pattern shifted to being stratified, a mixture of diffusion and jump dispersal that resulted in the creation of packs in close vicinity to existing groups. After 12 years of re-colonisation, wolves in Western Poland occupied about 30 % of potential suitable habitats. © 2016, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.

AB  - Silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium, Cav.) is one of the important invasive plant species in Mediterranean Basin countries. Over the last 60 years, this plant has gone from a few accidental introductions to near monospecific populations in many areas of the Mediterranean Basin (in particular Greece and Morocco). Recent findings from Lebanon show that the invasion is ongoing. Solanum elaeagnifolium has a negative impact on crops, causing up to 75% yield loss, as well as an indirect impact by harbouring plant pests and diseases. Solanum elaeagnifolium is toxic to livestock and has a negative affect on the quality of life for humans. Losses of potential resource or revenue caused by its invasion include: decreased forage quality on grazing lands; decreased cropping land and amenity values of public space; increased water loss; increased water conveyancing costs; and increased forest restoration costs. Available control techniques need to be strengthened to reduce the impact of S. elaeagnifolium and prevent its spread. More attention needs to be devoted to biological control, which could provide regional management of this invasive alien plant. Sustainable management of S. elaeagnifolium will require coordination, education and support across the affected countries. Governments must have the means to detect, manage and control S. elaeagnifolium. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - European and American chestnut species (Castanea) have been decimated by exotic species, most notably chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica), since the early nineteenth century. Backcross breeding programs that transfer blight disease resistance from Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima) into American chestnut (C. dentata) offer promise for chestnut restoration, particularly for the American chestnut which was a keystone species in eastern North America. Nursery prescriptions and conformity to desired American chestnut traits following planting must be tested, however, before blight resistance can even be evaluated. We tested early field performance of American and Chinese chestnut and hybrid seedlings from the third backcross generation (e.g., BC3F3) in two-aged regeneration harvests on highly productive sites in the southern Appalachians, USA. We also tested a common nursery prescription of grading seedlings by size prior to planting. BC3F3 seedlings had similar 4-year survival to American chestnut seedlings, but generally had smaller stem heights and ground-line diameters (GLD). Although blight had not yet substantially challenged some sites, the BC3F3 seedlings had blight incidence similar to the Chinese chestnut which was lower than the American chestnut. Visual seedling grading affected planting shock and stem height and GLD by the end of year 4. Large size-class seedlings had more stem dieback and 5 % lower survival compared to small size-class seedlings, but larger trees exhibited the same height in year 3 as small trees in year 4. Advanced breeding material (BC3F3) was successfully established during the stand initiation phase of forest development on highly productive sites, but deviations in desired growth rate of the American chestnut was evident. Visual grading of seedlings affected establishment of breeding material, and should be considered in the restoration process. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).

AB  - Mycophagous bioturbators provide ecosystem services that can be important for the resilience and restoration of ecosystems. Among the Australian mammals, mycophagy is most prevalent within the Potoroidae (bettongs and potoroos). However, proportionally more species of Potoroidae are either recently extinct or currently threatened than any other mammalian family in Australia, and they are among the least studied. The critically endangered woylie, or brush-tailed bettong (Bettongia penicillata), is a mycophagous, ground dwelling 'ecosystem engineer' that was one of Australia's most abundant and widely distributed potoroids prior to European settlement. After substantial range contraction, however, the remaining indigenous populations are now restricted to eucalypt forests in south-western Australia. Using an experimental approach, we investigated the population responses of the woylie to timber harvesting in these forests. Nine treatments, including varying logging intensities and unharvested controls, were applied at 22 sites. The abundance of the woylie in the harvested areas, in unharvested stands between logged areas, and in extensive unharvested stands outside the harvest management area were compared using a replicated before-after-control-impact (BACI) repeated measures design and capture-mark-recapture modelling. A total of 5860 captures of 815 individuals were recorded during 35 trapping sessions over 16 years (one year preceding, two years during, and 13 years after disturbance). Capture rate was a good index of abundance for this species and woylie abundance, survivorship and recruitment were not adversely affected by silvicultural practices in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest. On the contrary, the harvested areas may have afforded some localised protection when an unrelated, species-wide decline began three years after harvesting disturbance ended; woylie numbers declined by up to 77% and 95% in harvested and unharvested areas, respectively. Thus the nature and spatial extent of the timber harvesting regimes investigated in this study were not a major threatening process for this species. However, ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure that timber harvesting activities remain benign in the face of a changing climate, possible increased mortality from introduced predators, disease, and further declines in the abundance of this critically endangered marsupial. © 2015.

AB  - β-Thalassemia is a blood disease caused by a mutation in the second intron of the β-globin gene of hemoglobin that leads to abnormal hemoglobin production. Low molecular weight compounds have been proposed to modulate defective splicing by binding unwanted splicing sites, thereby restoring correct splicing. This study investigates the origin of this splice switching activity in a set of 39 active and 61,000 inactive compounds. The K-means algorithm was applied to the inactive compound points with 39 clusters, in which a point from each cluster was selected to create a balanced data set of 39 active and inactive compounds. To avoid random bias, predictive models (i.e., decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine (SVM)) were constructed 50 times. The performances of the predictive models were statistically assessed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). RF provided an accuracy of 89.50 ± 13.45, sensitivity of 94.97 ± 13.49, specificity of 84.29. ± 22.27, and MCC of 0.80 ± 0.25 for 10-fold CV, and it provided and accuracy of 88.00 ± 8.55, sensitivity of 87.89 ± 13.93, specificity of 87.51 ± 13.75, and MCC of 0.75 ± 0.18 for external testing. Taking advantage of the built-in feature selector of RF, a thorough analysis of feature importance was conducted. Newly identified fingerprint substructures, namely, three carbon-hetero bonds (i.e., secondary amide, tertiary amide, carboxyl derivative, carboxylic acid derivative and nitrile), carbon-carbon bonds (i.e., primary carbon, secondary carbon and alkene), aromatics (hetero N nonbasic) and carbon-hetero bond (alkyl aryl ether), may provide a better understanding of the structural variations governing the splice switching activity of the hemoglobin β-globin gene. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a common condition. It is reported to be a major health and socioeconomic problem associated with work absenteeism, disability and high costs for patients and society. Exercise is a modestly effective treatment for chronic LBP. However, current evidence suggests that no single form of exercise is superior to another. Among the most commonly used exercise interventions is motor control exercise (MCE). MCE intervention focuses on the activation of the deep trunk muscles and targets the restoration of control and co-ordination of these muscles, progressing to more complex and functional tasks integrating the activation of deep and global trunk muscles. While there are previous systematic reviews of the effectiveness of MCE, recently published trials justify an updated systematic review. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of MCE in patients with chronic non-specific LBP. Search methods: We conducted electronic searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases and two trials registers from their inception up to April 2015. We also performed citation tracking and searched the reference lists of reviews and eligible trials. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of MCE in patients with chronic non-specific LBP. We included trials comparing MCE with no treatment, another treatment or that added MCE as a supplement to other interventions. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. We considered function, quality of life, return to work or recurrence as secondary outcomes. All outcomes must have been measured with a valid and reliable instrument. Data collection and analysis: Two independent review authors screened the search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted the data. A third independent review author resolved any disagreement. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Back and Neck (CBN) Review Group expanded 12-item criteria (Furlan 2009). We extracted mean scores, standard deviations and sample sizes from the included trials, and if this information was not provided we calculated or estimated them using methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook. We also contacted the authors of the trials for any missing or unclear information. We considered the following time points: short-term (less than three months after randomisation); intermediate (at least three months but less than 12 months after randomisation); and long-term (12 months or more after randomisation) follow-up. We assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots, and by calculating the Chi2 test and the I2 statistic. We combined results in a meta-analysis expressed as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 29 trials (n = 2431) in this review. The study sample sizes ranged from 20 to 323 participants. We considered a total of 76.6% of the included trials to have a low risk of bias, representing 86% of all participants. There is low to high quality evidence that MCE is not clinically more effective than other exercises for all follow-up periods and outcomes tested. When compared with minimal intervention, there is low to moderate quality evidence that MCE is effective for improving pain at short, intermediate and long-term follow-up with medium effect sizes (long-term, MD -12.97; 95% CI -18.51 to -7.42). There was also a clinically important difference for the outcomes function and global impression of recovery compared with minimal intervention. There is moderate to high quality evidence that there is no clinically important difference between MCE and manual therapy for all follow-up periods and outcomes tested. Finally, there is very low to low quality evidence that MCE is clinically more effective than exercise and electrophysical agents (EPA) for pain, disability, global impression of recovery and quality of life with medium to large effect sizes (pain at short term, MD -30.18; 95% CI -35.32 to -25.05). Minor or no adverse events were reported in the included trials. Authors' conclusions: There is very low to moderate quality evidence that MCE has a clinically important effect compared with a minimal intervention for chronic low back pain. There is very low to low quality evidence that MCE has a clinically important effect compared with exercise plus EPA. There is moderate to high quality evidence that MCE provides similar outcomes to manual therapies and low to moderate quality evidence that it provides similar outcomes to other forms of exercises. Given the evidence that MCE is not superior to other forms of exercise, the choice of exercise for chronic LBP should probably depend on patient or therapist preferences, therapist training, costs and safety. © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - Disaster can be defined as an accident or an event, which may result in temporary or permanent change in the landscape and also may result in loss of lives and property. For India is vulnerable for many disasters. More than half of land area in vulnerable for earthquakes. About one tenth of land area is prone to cyclone and more than one tenth of land area is exposed to floods and about two third of land is subjected to droughts. The of rural land mars is under the threat of outbreak of diseases. Disasters are classified as Natural disasters and Manmade disasters. Though there are many types of natural and manmade Disasters, this study is restricted to the following disasters. The following are the common natural disasters commonly encountered in India namely, Earthquake, Tsunami, Volcano, Landslide, Cyclone, Flood and Forest Fire. India is vulnerable to the following manmade disasters namely, Act of Terrorism, Major transport accidents in air sea on road and on rails, Industrial Accidents, War, Nuclear Threat, Outbreak of diseases and Manmade fire. Communication during disasters plays vital role in saving the lives of the people. When disaster paralyses the normal life of the man, posing the danger of insecurity, it becomes primary responsibility of the government agencies to come to immediate rescue of the people and to restore peace and safe living condition of these disaster victims. Let us discuss the grey areas to be given due care in the event of natural disasters.

AB  - Landscape ecosystems of sea islands are undergoing drastic changes due to the combined effects of natural processes and anthropic activities. Fresh water is the foundation of sea-island life and the key constituent part of sea-island landscape ecosystem. The effect of anthropic activities on freshwater system is one of key topics of them on landscape ecosystems of sea island. As an isolated landscape ecosystem, almost the entire freshwater recharge of sea island comes from rainfall. The rainfall-intercepting capability is very important for maintaining the balance of fresh water of sea island. A number of studies suggested that landscape factors including cover type, soil group and treatment, obviously impacts on the rainfall-intercepting capability. Therefore, it is greatly significant to probe into the effect of landscape pattern on rainfall-intercepting capability of sea island and the quantitative relationship between them. Firstly, landscape patterns of Tantoushan Island in Xiangshan county, Zhejiang province, China, for 1966, 2004, and 2012 were produced through landscape identification and classification of multi-resource remote sensing KH-7 homochromatic, QuickBird multispectral, and WorldView-2 multispectral imageries, and contemporaneous historical data. Shrub and grass was consistently the dominant landscape class throughout the entire period. There were remarkable changes of landscape types and landscape area from 1966 to 2012. There was major loss of arable land from 1966 to 2004. Coniferous forest disappeared entirely from 1966 to 2004, and then reoccurred between 2004 and 2012. Broad-leaved forest appeared and expanded greatly from 1966 to 2004, then decreased slightly from 2004 to 2012. The area of bare rock and land showed an obvious increase, and shrub and grass showed a declining trend over the 46 years. Driving analysis indicated these drastic changes were caused by afforestation, changes in exploitation methods, human-induced fire and diseases, as well as natural succession. Then, based on a holistic viewpoint, the paper researched into the quantitative relation between landscape pattern of sea island and rainfall-intercepting capability by the example of Tantoushan Island, and developed a comprehensive index——Total Rainfall Loss Rate (TRLR) used to assess the effect of landscape changes on rainfall loss quickly. TRLR is a simple weighted sum of CN values representing the runoff potential of specific landscape types from the TR-55 runoff prediction model. The results showed a continuous rise in TRLR of Tantoushan Island from 1966 to 2012, which suggested a continuous decline of the rainfall-intercepting capability. From 1966 to 2004, 2012, area ratio of shrub and grass to the whole landscape ecosystem decreased from 80.18% to 66.43%,60.15%, which was the major cause leading to the decline of rainfall-intercepting capability of Tantoushan Island. This trend is bound to do harm to freshwater prism, and then threatens the whole landscape ecosystem of sea island. The variation in TRLR must receive enough attention, and the effective countermeasures should be adopted to keep and even enhance the rainfall-intercepting capability for the health and sustainability of Tantoushan Island. In view of the rainfall-intercepting capability of single landscape type, shrub and grass landscape might be a priority rather than broadleaved forest and coniferous forest in island restoration project. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

AB  - Throughout much of the range of western white pine, Pinus monticola Dougl., timber harvesting, fire exclusion and the presence of Cronartium ribicola J. C. Fisch., the white pine blister rust (WPBR) pathogen, have led to negative population and genetic consequences. To address these interactions, we examined population dynamics and genetic diversity in 10 populations of western white pine in upper montane forests of the Lake Tahoe Basin. We documented negative population trends for three of the 10 populations. These populations exhibited low estimated growth rates (λ), moderate to high incidences of WPBR and mountain pine beetle (MPB), and high levels of mortality. In contrast, seven populations appear to be stable (λ ≥ 1.0), with low to moderate disease and insect incidence, and evidence for genetic resistance to WPBR. Genetic diversity (HE) for a set of 160 single nucleotide polymorphisms was in the range of 0.245-0.272 across populations, and population-specific estimates of FST ranged from 0.0062 to 0.0244. Allele frequency of the Cr2 gene, which confers complete resistance to C. ribicola in western white pine, was low, averaging 0.009 for all populations sampled. However, a low frequency of pollen receptors (i.e., susceptible maternal parents pollinated by a local resistant parent) was found in nine of 10 populations. A moderate and negative relationship was found between the frequency of pollen receptors in a population and the incidence of WPBR (r2 = 0.32). In the context of an introduced pathogen, climate driven outbreaks of MPB, fire exclusion, and prolonged drought, conservation and management strategies are warranted for this species in the Lake Tahoe Basin and likely other locations in California. These strategies include gene conservation of western white pine, WPBR resistance screening, and forest restoration treatments. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Restoration of foundation species, such as the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) that was devastated by an introduced fungus, can restore ecosystem function. Understanding both the current distribution as well as biogeographic patterns is important for restoration planning. We used United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data to quantify the current density and distribution of C. dentata. We then review the literature concerning biogeographic patterns in C. dentata. Currently, 431 ± 30.2 million stems remain. The vast majority (360 ± 22 million) are sprouts < 2.5 cm dbh. Although this number is approximately 10% of the estimated pre-blight population, blight has caused a major shift in the size structure. The current-day population has a larger range, particularly west and north, likely due to human translocation. While climate change could facilitate northward expansion, limited seed reproduction makes this unlikely without assisted migration. Previous research demonstrates that the current, smaller population contains slightly higher genetic diversity than expected, although little information exists on biogeographic patterns in the genetics of adaptive traits. Our research provides a baseline characterization of the contemporary population of C. dentata, to enable monitoring stem densities and range limits to support restoration efforts. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Combined effects of the recent mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak and white pine blister rust (caused by Cronartium ribicola) (WPBR) are causing extensive crown dieback and mortality in limber pine (Pinus flexilis) in the central and southern Rocky Mountains. Additional stressors such as climate change and limber pine dwarf mistletoe (Aceuthobium cyanocarpum) may significantly alter stand structure and biodiversity of these ecosystems. The objectives of this study were to: (1) assess site, stand, and tree health conditions in limber pine stands of northern Colorado, Wyoming, and southeastern Montana, (2) quantify impacts of WPBR, bark beetles, and dwarf mistletoe, and (3) determine biotic and abiotic factors that influence the occurrence and incidence of these damage agents.We assessed 22,700 limber pines on 508 plots in limber pine-dominated stands in twenty-five study areas in northern Colorado, Wyoming, and southeastern Montana. Average live limber pine density was 311stemsha-1. Overall, 50% of limber pines were classified as healthy with over 50% of limber pine mortality attributed to bark beetle attacks. White pine blister rust damage was evident on over 60% of declining or dying limber pines. Blister rust was the primary damage agent, occurring on 73% of the plots and 26% of the trees. Bark beetle-caused mortality was found on 75% of plots and 18% of trees. Limber pine dwarf mistletoe was present on 29% of plots and 9% of trees. In study areas that were previously monitored, incidence of WPBR increased over 8-9years by 6%, bark beetle-caused mortality by 17%, while dwarf mistletoe incidence remained the same. We used statistical modeling to determine meteorological, macro and micro site factors, and stand factors that influenced the occurrence and incidence of WPBR, bark beetles, and dwarf mistletoe on limber pines.Declines in health and rise in mortality due to bark beetles and WPBR has left some study areas with low limber pine basal area and stand density. These stands may be at risk for localized extirpation if the minimum viable population thresholds are not maintained and are identified as areas of concern for restoration and conservation efforts. Current condition status and long-term monitoring of limber pine is needed for land manager decision making and facilitation of restoration goals. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Active management is needed to sustain healthy limber pine (Pinus flexilis E. James) forests in the Southern Rocky Mountains (henceforth, Southern Rockies), as they are threatened by the interaction of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) epidemic, climate change, and the spread of the non-native pathogen that causes white pine blister rust disease (Cronartium ribicola A. Dietr.). Appropriate source material for restoration and proactive introduction needs to be selected, taking into account potential genetic differentiation that would hamper management success.Weconducted a common garden study in a greenhouse to determine the degree of genetic differentiationamonglimber pine populations in the Southern Rockies. Weevaluated the differential responses of populations from northern and southern portions of the Southern Rockies to different moisture regimes during early seedling growth by measuring primary needle length, stem diameter, water potential, biomass allocation between root and shoot, and carbon isotope ratios ([1]13C; a proxy for water-use efficiency). There were significant (p < 0.05) effects of source region for root length, stem diameter, needle length, and total dry mass, with seedlings from southern sources bigger than seedlings from northern sources. Furthermore, there was a marginally significant interaction between soil moisture regime and source region for carbon isotope ratio (p = 0.0778), suggesting possible local adaptation. These data indicate that genetic differentiation exists among populations in the Southern Rockies, potentially increasing the risk of maladaptation when moving seed far from its source for active management. © 2014, National Research Council of Canada.All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior to the reintroduction of a species, managers need an understanding of the expected behavior of the species in the new habitat. How a species uses its habitat and how much space individuals require are particularly important when conservation lands are limited. Critically endangered Maui Parrotbills (Kiwikiu, Pseudonestor xanthophrys) once occupied a variety of habitats on the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Moloka'i, but, due to habitat loss and disease, are now restricted to a fraction of their former range. To prevent their extinction, reintroducing parrotbills to historically occupied native, mesic forest on the leeward slopes of Haleakalā is considered a critical recovery action. Managers have selected Nakula Natural Area Reserve (NAR) as the site of translocation and restoration efforts are currently underway to support this goal. In addition, other species, including endemic Maui 'Alauahio (Maui Creeper, Paroreomyza montana), may recolonize these forests naturally as the habitat improves. However, estimates of the home range sizes of focal species are needed so that managers can estimate how many individuals might be able to occupy new habitats. Our objective therefore was to estimate the home range sizes of parrotbills and 'alauahio at three sites within their current ranges to provide estimates of typical habitat and space use patterns. Using resightings of color-banded birds from 2007 to 2014, we calculated home ranges using minimum convex polygons and kernel density estimators. Depending on estimation technique, parrotbill home ranges were estimated to encompass 9.29 ± 1.29 (SE) ha or 9.63 ± 1.51 ha, and pairs occupied ranges of 11.8 ha or 14.5 ha. 'Alauahio home ranges were 0.85 ± 0.09 ha or 0.87 ± 0.08 ha in size. Home range sizes varied among study sites for both species, likely reflecting the influence of local habitat attributes and quality on movement patterns and space use. Although we do not know how these species will behave in the new habitat, our estimates of home range size provide guidance for managers planning the reintroduction of parrotbills to Nakula NAR. © 2015 Association of Field Ornithologists.

AB  - Limited resources for biodiversity conservation demand strategic science-based recovery efforts, particularly on islands, which are global hotspots of both endemism and extinction. The Akikiki (Oreomystis bairdi) and the Akekee (Loxops caeruleirostris) are critically endangered honeycreepers endemic to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Recent declines and range contraction spurred investigation of the habitat characteristics influencing range-wide occupancyof these species. We surveyed Akikiki and Akekee and habitat covariates within 5 study areas on the Alakai Plateau of Kauai along a gradient of forest conditions. Occupancy rates for both species increased from west to east along theplateau (Akikiki: ψ=0.02 6 0.07 to 0.55 6 0.21; Akekee: ψ=0.03 6 0.10 to 0.53 6 0.33), but were low throughout the ranges of both species. Canopy height was positively correlated with occupancy for both species, which suggests thedamage done by hurricanes in 1982 and 1992 may be one factor restricting these birds to the most intact forest remaining. Vegetation surveys revealed several key differences in forest composition and structure between areas, indicative of broader changes occurring across the plateau. Invasive plants such as Himalayan ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) were dominant in the western portion of the plateau, where there was a corresponding decline innative plant cover. Conversely, ground disturbance by feral ungulates was higher in more eastern native-dominated areas. These results highlight the need to protect habitat in the regions where Akikiki and Akekee occupancy ishighest, and restore habitat in other parts of their range. These actions should occur in concert with the mitigation of other known threats to Hawaiian honeycreepers such as avian disease. Without significant investment to address thesethreats and protect suitable habitat for these species, it is unclear how long these birds will persist. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.

AB  - Musk deer (Moschus spp.) are small forest ungulates that are unique to Asia and are mainly distributed in China. In the last 30 years, because of indiscriminate trapping, hunting, and killing of the musk deer for musk and the loss of suitable habitat due to deforestation, the distribution and population of wild musk deer have declined. The Chinese government has proposed a protection plan for musk deer, and promoted the musk deer's reintroduction as an important population restoration measure. However, a limited amount of research is available regarding the behavior of artificial populations and disease control and prevention, and very few studies have been undertaken to determine the role of nutrition in the successful reintroduction of musk deer. Therefore, we reviewed the related studies on nutrition of musk deer, considered the habitats, artificial breeding, and disease prevention, and assessed potential problems in population recovery of the musk deer. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tomorrow’s forests face extreme pressures from contemporary climate change, invasive pests, and anthropogenic demands for other land uses. These pressures, collectively, demand land managers to reassess current and potential forest management practices. We discuss three considerations, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, which are currently being debated in the literature and have the potential to be applied independently or concurrently across a variety of scales. The emphasis of functional restoration is to reestablish or maintain functions provided by the forest ecosystem, such as water quality, wildlife habitat, or carbon sequestration. Maintaining function may call upon actions such as assisted migration—moving tree populations within a species current range to aid adaptation to climate change or moving a species far outside its current range to avoid extinction—and we attempt to synthesize an array of assisted migration terminology. In addition, maintenance of species and the functions they provide may also require new technologies, such as genetic engineering, which, compared with traditional approaches to breeding for pest resistance, may be accomplished more rapidly to meet and overcome the challenges of invasive insect and disease pests. As managers develop holistic adaptive strategies to current and future anthropogenic stresses, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, either separately or in combinations, deserve consideration, but must be addressed within the context of the restoration goal. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht(outside the USA).

AB  - For more than a century ecosystems around the world have experienced an increase in the dominance of woody species. While the drivers of woody plant proliferation are complex, interactions between climate and land-use change are commonly invoked as primary contributing factors. In ponderosa pine forests of western North America, substantial increases in tree densities are impacting overall forest health and increasing the risk for severe wildfires and insect and disease outbreaks. Addressing this problem through the use of ecological restoration projects is widely advocated. Our objective was to quantify understory vegetation response five years after thinning and burning treatments in a southwestern ponderosa pine forest. We remeasured plant species richness and cover on thinned + burned, burned only, and untreated controls replicated four time in a BACI design. An untreated control (Untreated) was used for comparison of two alternative restoration treatments (1) thinning followed by prescribed fire (Thin + Burn) and (2) prescribed fire only (Burn-only). Understory species richness and total plant cover increased significantly in Thin + Burn compared to the Untreated and Burn-only treatments. Analysis of functional group composition revealed increases in species richness and cover was driven primarily by changes in annual-biennial forbs and graminoids. We then compared our results with those of three Long-term Ecological Restoration and Assessment Network (LEARN) sites. We found total and native plant cover showed evidence of a consistent response to Thin + Burn treatments across all sites. However, results suggest that understory response to restoration treatments is under strong environmental control. As a consequence the range of variability associated with understory responses should be expected to expand or contract depending on where treatments are implemented. Overall our findings add to a growing body of literature that restoration treatments combining mechanical thinning and prescribed fire are useful for increasing native understory abundance and diversity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) populations are in decline across the species’ range due to historic wildfire exclusion, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae, MPB) outbreaks, and an invasive fungal pathogen causing the disease white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola, WPBR). Despite reliance on stand-replacing fires, information on whitebark pine regeneration occurrence is limited and the trajectory of future forests is largely unknown in some areas of the range. Regeneration densities were assessed in burned and adjacent non-burned areas at six high elevation locations in northwest Wyoming where stand-replacing fires occurred 8–32 years before the surveys. In these locations at the eastern extent of the species range, we assessed what site factors were associated with regeneration success. Whitebark pine regeneration density was greater and seedlings were older in non-burned compared to burned areas. Within burns, north aspects had more regeneration than south aspects. Potential seed source densities and other species’ regeneration were positively related to whitebark pine regeneration densities in burned areas. South facing slopes or grass covered areas may have either delayed or no regeneration of whitebark pine without the help of artificial planting. © 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Forests play an important role, contributing to human health and well-being as environments for recreation and rehabilitation. Stress has become a significant problem in modern societies, and the importance of forests as environments for stress relief has been recognized in recent years. To maintain and create forests for rehabilitation, consideration of their rehabilitation value needs to be incorporated into forest management planning and to do this, we need to define and quantify the characteristics of good rehabilitation forests. This study presents an approach for including rehabilitation value as an aspect of forest management planning. This approach is applied to three case study areas in northern, middle and southern Sweden to identify trade-offs between maintaining high wood production while creating forest areas suitable for rehabilitation from stress-related diseases. The results show that quite large areas of rehabilitation forest (10–15 % of total forest area) can be maintained at a relatively small loss in economic net present value (NPV) of wood production (ca 2 % of maximum NPV). When using the rehabilitation value indicator defined in this study, age and spatial variables (distance to roads and water) seem to be the most limiting factors. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Plants often facilitate each other in harsh environments, and facilitation appears to be important for conifer recruitment in subalpine forests and the formation of treelines. This study investigated the potential role of facilitation for the establishment of Pinus albicaulis (whitebark pine), a dominant Rocky Mountain tree species that is in decline due to an exotic blister rust disease (. Cronartium ribicola), bark beetle outbreaks, and fire suppression. Surveys were conducted at five subalpine sites for spatial associations between naturally regenerating P. albicaulis seedlings and other plant species, and found that the cover of Vaccinium scoparium was higher in proximity to P. albicaulis seedlings. In transplant experiments, survival of P. albicaulis seedlings was higher when planted with V. scoparium and in shade cloth treatments, but neither survival nor growth rates were altered by clipping or rhizome severing of V. scoparium, suggesting a below-ground rather than above-ground facilitation mechanism. In contrast, Carex species reduced the survival and growth rates of P. albicaulis. In a fertilization experiment, no effect of nitrogen and/or phosphorous fertilization was found on Pinus albicaulis seedling growth, but seedlings growing with V. scoparium had higher growth rates and increased leaf phosphorus concentrations relative to seedlings growing in bare ground. In a microcosm experiment, P. albicaulis seedlings growing with V. scoparium had higher growth rates and leaf phosphorus concentrations than when grown alone, but only if P. albicaulis needles were added on the soil surface. My results suggest success of restoration plantings of greenhouse grown P. albicaulis seedlings may be improved by planting in areas where V. scoparium occurs, and avoiding areas dominated by Carex species. Removal of adjacent vegetation prior to planting seedlings may be ineffective in significantly altering either positive or negative effects of the neighboring plants. Selection of sites with adjacent shading elements, such as rocks, logs, stumps, or snags, may also improve seedling survival. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Results of the long-term analysis of the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) and its settlements in the Pushta River basin and Moksha River floodplain lakes in the southeastern part of the Mordovia State Nature Reserve during the period of 1940–2013 are described. The numbers of beaver settlements and animals living there 73 years after they were reintroduced have stabilized in the ranges of 20–29 settlements and 65–96 individuals. The performed integrated analysis of environmental conditions, climate, hydrological network, and the effects of predators, diseases, spatial arrangement of settlements, size of the settlemetns, number of dams in settlements, specific foraging features, and food resources, as well as mathematical data processing using the classic models of population dynamics (Malthus, Beverton–Holt, and Ricker) and a time series analysis, suggests that the dynamics is at a climax stage with a fluctuation at low abundance level. A hypothetical theoretical qualitative model of the long-term beaver population dynamics is discussed for different restoration rates of food resources. Using this model, it is shown that typical of the population dynamics in the Berezinsky Biosphere Reserve and Oksky Nature Reserve as well as Allegheny National Forest is a high restoration rate of food resources (type I dynamics). On the other hand, characteristic of the population dynamics in the Lapland, Il’menskii, PechoraIlych, and Mordovia nature reserves is a low restoration rate of food resources (type II dynamics). It is inferred that the further development of the beaver population in the Mordovia Nature Reserve will mainly depend on the functional (the rate of food restoration in abandoned habitats as well as the growth scale and rate of black alder stands in the abandoned beaver settlements) and random (cold winters, winter floods, and droughts) factors influencing the beaver population dynamics in the nature reserve. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - We employed tree-ring analysis to reconstruct the fire history of High Park, Toronto, Canada, in one of the largest remnants of black oak (Quercus velutina) savanna in Ontario. This heavily urbanized area has a long history of fire suppression, which has degraded the native savanna. Efforts to reintroduce fire would benefit from a fire history record. Ring width patterns were quantified for 38 black oak chronologies on 14 cross-sections and 10 cores using dendrochronology software that employs scanned (digital) ring sequences. Scar and sealing patterns and rapid growth responses following scarring were dated to indicate the timing of fire events. These dates were compared with the timing of regeneration pulses and the establishment of multistemmed individuals that would have sprouted in response to fire disturbance. Our records suggest that most of the mature black oak stems established synchronously, around 1865, following an apparently extensive fire event or set of events. We have evidence of four other fires in the century that followed. Dendrochronology in black oak savanna presents challenges due to this tree species' thick bark, and the low intensity savanna fires that do not breach all individuals in a stand. Further, the present black oak population has succumbed to disease and old age, leading to decay of the central stem and the loss of the oldest rings that were more likely to be scarred as they formed during the tree's youth. This is likely to be a limitation in other savanna communities in long-settled regions of North America. We suggest inclusion of corroborative evidence, such as that employed in the present study, including the use of multistemmed individuals as indicators of stem recruitment following fire, and demographic data for the population.

AB  - The prevalence of allergic airway diseases such as asthma and rhinitis has increased dramatically to epidemic proportions worldwide. Besides air pollution from industry derived emissions and motor vehicles, the rising trend can only be explained by gross changes in the environments where we live. The world economy has been transformed over the last 25 years with developing countries being at the core of these changes. Around the planet, in both developed and developing countries, environments are undergoing profound changes. Many of these changes are considered to have negative effects on respiratory health and to enhance the frequency and severity of respiratory diseases such as asthma in the general population. Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere have already warmed the planet substantially, causing more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods - all of which can put the respiratory health of the public at risk. These changes in climate and air quality have a measurable impact not only on the morbidity but also the mortality of patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases. The massive increase in emissions of air pollutants due to economic and industrial growth in the last century has made air quality an environmental problem of the first order in a large number of regions of the world. A body of evidence suggests that major changes to our world are occurring and involve the atmosphere and its associated climate. These changes, including global warming induced by human activity, have an impact on the biosphere, biodiversity, and the human environment. Mitigating this huge health impact and reversing the effects of these changes are major challenges. This statement of the World Allergy Organization (WAO) raises the importance of this health hazard and highlights the facts on climate-related health impacts, including: deaths and acute morbidity due to heat waves and extreme meteorological events; increased frequency of acute cardio-respiratory events due to higher concentrations of ground level ozone; changes in the frequency of respiratory diseases due to trans-boundary particle pollution; altered spatial and temporal distribution of allergens (pollens, molds, and mites); and some infectious disease vectors. According to this report, these impacts will not only affect those with current asthma but also increase the incidence and prevalence of allergic respiratory conditions and of asthma. The effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still not well defined, and more studies addressing this topic are needed. Global warming is expected to affect the start, duration, and intensity of the pollen season on the one hand, and the rate of asthma exacerbations due to air pollution, respiratory infections, and/or cold air inhalation, and other conditions on the other hand. © 2015 D'Amato et al.

AB  - Abstract: Habitat restoration for inland trout (family Salmonidae) is common across western North America, but planners rarely consider disease risk when prioritizing restoration sites. Whirling disease is a parasitic infection caused by the invasive myxosporean parasite Myxobolus cerebralis and has been implicated in declines of wild trout populations across western North America. For planners to consider disease, disease risk needs to be predictable across the landscape and influence restoration outcomes. We collated the history of whirling disease infection severity scores on the MacConnell–Baldwin scale from sentinel cage studies for hatchery Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Blackfoot River basin from 1998 to 2009. At these same sites, we performed reach-scale geomorphic assessments, derived landscape variables from GIS data layers, and assembled fish composition data. We examined relationships between the severity of infection and several landscape-scale and reach-scale variables for 13 basin-fed streams in the Blackfoot River basin of west-central Montana using classification and regression tree analyses. In our data set, valley slope and forest cover were the best predictors of fine sediment. Both spring creeks and gently sloping alluvial basin-fed tributaries to the Blackfoot River basin with higher proportions of fine sediment (particle size < 0.85 mm) were associated with a high severity (≥ grade 3) of infection. Additionally, we explored differences in trout species composition (i.e., susceptible versus resistant species) before and after the whirling disease enzootic using seven basin-fed streams and two spring creeks. We did not detect trout community shifts from susceptible to disease-resistant salmonids in basin-fed disease-positive streams. However, spring creeks showed a negative trend in disease-susceptible salmonids after the whirling disease enzootic. Disease risk appears to be predictable across the landscape and may limit possible restoration outcomes by influencing species composition in spring creeks.

AB  - The world's dams and reservoirs are aging. The ecological effects of a half-century or more of flow regulation and sediment alteration are becoming apparent. What remains of the highly dynamic channel and riparian ecosystem of the Missouri River described by Lewis and Clark has become static. Recent long-term studies have determined that some of the impacts on the Missouri River ecosystem turned out as predicted, such as the failure of cottonwood-dominated riparian forests to successfully establish and survive on a broad scale. Other changes were surprises, such as the effect of disease eliminating a formerly dominant tree species and the appearance of mainstem and tributary deltas affecting channel slope, floodplain hydrology, and vegetation. Restoration of the river's hydrologic and sediment regime has been delayed long enough that the chances of functional ecosystem restoration have been greatly reduced and complicated. Two phases are now needed to attempt to restore the riparian ecosystem: one to repair the effects of post-dam changes (channel incision, bank stabilization) and another to reestablish pre-dam flow and sediment regimes. The prospects for restoration of this valuable ecosystem, rich in history and in goods and services provided to the public, are dim. Time has diminished the chances that restoration or even rehabilitation can be achieved. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background Alzheimer's disease, a lethal neurodegenerative disorder that leads to progressive memory loss, is the most common form of dementia. Owing to the complexity of the disease, its root cause still remains unclear. The existing anti-Alzheimer's drugs are unable to cure the disease while the current therapeutic options have provided only limited help in restoring moderate memory and remain ineffective at restricting the disease's progression. The striatalenriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) has been shown to be involved in the internalization of the receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDR) and thus is associated with the disease. The present study was performed using machine learning algorithms, docking protocol and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop STEP inhibitors, which could be novel anti-Alzheimer's molecules. Methods The present study deals with the generation of computational predictive models based on chemical descriptors of compounds using machine learning approaches followed by substructure fragment analysis. To perform this analysis, the 2D molecular descriptors were generated and machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Sequential Minimization Optimization) were utilized. The binding mechanisms and the molecular interactions between the predicted active compounds and the target protein were modelled using docking methods. Further, the stability of the protein-ligand complex was evaluated using MD simulation studies. The substructure fragment analysis was performed using Substructure fingerprint (SubFp), which was further explored using a predefined dictionary. Results The present study demonstrates that the computational methodology used can be employed to examine the biological activities of small molecules and prioritize them for experimental screening. Large unscreened chemical libraries can be screened to identify potential novel hits and accelerate the drug discovery process. Additionally, the chemical libraries can be searched for significant substructure patterns as reported in the present study, thus possibly contributing to the activity of these molecules. © 2015 Jamal et al.

AB  - Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) populations are declining nearly rangewide from a combination of factors, including mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, 1902) outbreaks, the exotic pathogen Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch. 1872, which causes the disease white pine blister rust, and successional replacement due to historical fire exclusion practices. With high mortality in cone-bearing whitebark pine, seed production may not be sufficient to support natural regeneration after disturbance such as wildfire. Our objective was to examine the relationship between whitebark pine seed source health and whitebark pine regeneration density in adjacent burns. We sampled regeneration and seed source health in 15 burns within six national forests and three Wilderness Areas in Montana, ranging from 5 to 23 years old. We found a significant, positive relationship between seed source health and seedling density in adjacent burns. Natural regeneration was sparse when the proportion of damaged or dead whitebark pine in the seed source exceeded 50%. Factors that influenced the presence of whitebark pine regeneration within a burn included both vegetation cover and potential solar radiation. Sites closer to seed sources had higher probabilities of seedling occurrence, but seedlings were present throughout most burns. Our results suggest that managers can prioritize restoration plantings of whitebark pine seedlings after wildfire based on the health status of the nearest seed sources. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Ectomycorrhiza is a kind of fungus-plant symbiotic that plays an important role in the performance, maintenance, improvement of the situation after the destruction, biodiversity evolution, stability and better and more efficiency from ecosystems. Ectomycorrhiza can be considered as an integral component of the biology and ecology of soil that has a significant impact on the growth and absorption of nutrients and protection against diseases. Given that today's concern of humanity is loss, damage or diminish of important economical species in the environment, ectomycorrhizal identifying is considered as an essential understanding of research in tropical and non-tropical forests. This paper is an overview of the diversity and performance knowledge of ectomycorrhiza and its impact on plant diversity, composition, restoration, dynamism and amount of biomass in the ecosystem. This paper also discussed about ectomycorrhizal effects and tolerance of these fungi in hard environmental conditions and their reflection in this situation such as nutrient deficiency, stress, drought, salinity and ultramafic soils and the effects of these fungi in the stability of ecosystems and climatic diversity of these fungi. This paper shows that ectomycorrhiza fungus is an integral part of plant physiology and also, plays a key role in plant adaptation to specific environmental conditions, but whether the ectomycorrhiza can be a promising tool for biological relationship between soil and plants and a natural and useful program to restore damaged nature?

AB  - Many European countries have undertaken the static preservation of native elm genotypes in clone collections maintained ex situ. Less development has been devoted to the dynamic conservation of elm populations in situ. Case studies of elm conservation in France are given here as an illustration of methods employed at country level. We also briefly review the process used by the “European Forest Genetic Resources Programme” (EUFORGEN) to monitor elm dynamic conservation in a pan-European perspective. Dynamic conservation methods were promoted by EUFORGEN through leaflets, strategies, Technical Guidelines and the geo-referenced database EUFGIS on Dynamic Conservation Units (DCUs). Because the network of DCUs needs to be representative of the partitioning of adaptive diversity across the species distribution range, a GIS-aided approach has been developed to position DCUs in environmental zones and identify conservation gaps. The two DCUs of European white elm (Ulmus laevis Pall.) selected in riparian forests of two different climatic zones of France show that management oriented toward habitat protection is compatible with dynamic conservation, and that the species can still be conserved in situ in spite of Dutch Elm Disease (DED). Collaboration with habitat conservationists enabled the monitoring of losses to DED and the assessment of within- population diversity for flowering phenology. Collaboration with forest geneticists revealed that the diversity of the Garonne population was low, but that it contained rare DNA variants and adaptive traits. Since 1987, experimental restoration of countryside hedges has been carried out, using field elm clones (U. minor Mill.) selected from the French national collection and tested for lower susceptibility to the agent of DED in artificial inoculation tests. Such plantations can be viewed as a very dynamic form of conservation if they permit the local gene pool to be reinforced with trees able to reach sexual maturity and exchange pollen with elms in the neighborhood, hence contributing new genotypes that will be submitted to natural selection and provide fuel for ongoing adaptation processes. Initiatives assembling a large consortium of stakeholders, including habitat conservationists and hedge re-constructors, are needed to trigger new conservation projects. © SISEF http://www.sisef.it/iforest/

AB  - The pine and fir forests of the Yakama Reservation in south-central Washington State are managed using combinations of even-aged and uneven-aged silvicultural systems. Forest health is a major concern, and, therefore, silvicultural prescriptions are designed to restore forest conditions so that appropriate tree species composition and density will reduce the likelihood of insect and disease outbreaks. Timber harvests are important for social reasons that include jobs and income for tribal members; however, timber harvests are primarily designed to achieve a number of forest health and wildlife habitat objectives. This chapter describes the challenges faced by tribal leaders and the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs in designing a plan that addresses the economic, environmental, social, and cultural concerns of the Yakama Nation. The plan that was developed in 2005 was heavily influenced by historical practices and naturally occurring events, and it represents an ecosystem-based approach to forest management. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Acacia koa is a valuable tree species economically, ecologically and culturally in Hawai'i. A vascular wilt disease of A. koa resulting from infection by the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. koae (FOXY) causes high rates of mortality in field plantings and threatens native A. koa forests in Hawai'i. Landowners are reluctant to consider A. koa for reforestation and restoration in many areas due to the threat of FOXY. Producing seeds or propagules with genetic resistance to FOXY is vital to successful A. koa reforestation and restoration. Virulent FOXY isolates were used in seedling inoculation trials to evaluate resistance levels among A. koa families in greenhouse experiments. Seedling survival varied by family, ranging from 3% to 92%, with an overall average of 46%. One clonal and three seedling field trials were established in 2012 and 2013 using selected families based on the inoculation trials. The greenhouse screening method serves as a powerful tool to rapidly evaluate A. koa families prior to outplanting, but the field trial data are needed to further validate the results and to monitor the durability over time. The field trials will also serve as a source of germplasm for selection of other commercial traits. © 2015, Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - Due to habitat loss, disease, and introduction of nonnative species, many native species in Hawai'i have gone extinct or are at risk of extinction. As a result of interspecific interactions such as pollination, the decline, loss, or introduction of species can have cascading effects on island ecosystems. We studied Hylaeus spp., Hawai'i's yellow-faced bees, the only native bees in Hawai'i. This group of potentially important pollinators has been largely overlooked until recently, and its conservation status and ecological role are virtually unknown. We investigated how native ( Hylaeus spp.) and nonnative (Apis mellifera) bees interact with flowering plants in a large-scale pasture-to-forest restoration system. We used pan traps and nets to collect bees in mature forest, remnant corridors, planted Acacia koa tracts, and open pastureland. We removed pollen from each specimen and identified it using pollen samples collected on-site. We found that Hylaeus spp. were more likely to carry less pollen and more likely to exhibit higher pollinator fidelity compared with A. mellifera. By contrast, A. mellifera was more likely to carry mixed pollen and forage on invasive plant species. This is the first investigation in Hawai'i to compare patterns of pollen carriage between native and nonnative bees and the first study to document pollen carried by Hylaeus spp. in the context of forest restoration. © 2015 by University of Hawai'i Press.

AB  - The combination of traditional knowledge and modern biological technology promotes the biodiversity conservation and sustainable utilization in China, which embodies in biological pharmaceutical, healthcare, crop breeding and cultivation, control of disease and insect pest, forest management and administration, ecological protection, restoration and construction, and so on. Here we list the following aspects. First, the conservation and utilization of medicinal bioresources have been gradually formed a multilevel, multifaceted, and multidisciplinary characteristic and achieved remarkable results. Second, China is one of the early countries that conduct the ocean ecosystem dynamics research, including from the structure and process of ocean ecosystem to the ecosystem service and production function, which laid the groundwork for the sustainable development of the ocean ecosystem. Third, intercropping, as one of the multiple cropping systems, is the essence of Chinese traditional agriculture. We have conducted plenty of intercropping practices about increasing production and efficient use of resources, including legumes and nonlegumes intercropping, single cotyledon and dicotyledonous intercropping, gramineae and nongramineous intercropping, and so on. In addition, intercropping can increase the species diversity of farmland ecosystem, improve utilization of system resources for biology, sufficiently protect and use natural enemy, and inhibit pest outbreaks. Finally, agricultural heritage, as a traditionally sustainable agriculture practices, also plays an important role on biodiversity protection and utilization. Currently, this research on agricultural heritage mainly concentrated on the theoretical consideration of agricultural heritage, agrobiodiversity characteristics of agricultural heritage, multivalues of agricultural heritage dynamic conservation, substitute industry, and development law and policy on conservation of agricultural heritage. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and Higher Education Press 2015.

AB  - American chestnut (Castanea dentata [Marsh.] Borkh.) dominated the eastern forests of North America, serving as a keystone species both ecologically and economically until the introduction of the chestnut blight, Cryphonectria parasitica, functionally eradicated the species. Restoration efforts include genetic transformation utilizing genes such as oxalate oxidase to produce potentially blight-resistant chestnut trees that could be released back into the native range. However, before such a release can be undertaken, it is necessary to assess nontarget impacts. Since oxalate oxidase is meant to combat a fungal pathogen, we are particularly interested in potential impacts of this transgene on beneficial fungi. This study compares ectomycorrhizal fungal colonization on a transgenic American chestnut clone expressing enhanced blight resistance to a wild-type American chestnut, a conventionally bred American-Chinese hybrid chestnut, and other Fagaceae species. A greenhouse bioassay used soil from two field sites with different soil types and land use histories. The number of colonized root tips was counted, and fungal species were identified using morphology, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and DNA sequencing. Results showed that total ectomycorrhizal colonization varied more by soil type than by tree species. Individual fungal species varied in their colonization rates, but there were no significant differences between colonization on transgenic and wild-type chestnuts. This study shows that the oxalate oxidase gene can increase resistance against Cryphonectria parasitica without changing the colonization rate for ectomycorrhizal species. These findings will be crucial for a potential deregulation of blight-resistant American chestnuts containing the oxalate oxidase gene. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Widespread habitat degradation and uncharacteristic fire, insect, and disease outbreaks in forests across the western United States have led to highly publicized calls to increase the pace and scale of forest restoration. Despite these calls, we frequently lack a comprehensive understanding of forest restoration needs. In this study we demonstrate a new approach for evaluating where, how much, and what types of restoration are needed to move present day landscape scale forest structure towards a Natural Range of Variability (NRV) across eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, and southwestern Oregon. Our approach builds on the conceptual framework of the LANDFIRE and Fire Regime Condition Class programs. Washington-Oregon specific datasets are used to assess the need for changes to current forest structure resulting from disturbance and/or succession at watershed and regional scales. Across our analysis region we found that changes in current structure would be needed on an estimated 4.7. million+ ha (40% of all coniferous forests) in order to restore forest structure approximating NRV at the landscape scale. Both the overall level and the type of restoration need varied greatly between forested biophysical settings. Regional restoration needs were dominated by the estimated 3.8+ million ha in need of thinning and/or low severity fire in forests that were historically maintained by frequent low or mixed severity fire (historical Fire Regime Group I and III biophysical settings). However, disturbance alone cannot restore NRV forest structure. We found that time to transition into later development structural classes through successional processes was required on approximately 3.2. million ha (over 25% of all coniferous forests). On an estimated 2.3. million ha we identified that disturbance followed by succession was required to restore NRV forest structure. The results of this study are intended to facilitate the ability of local land managers to incorporate regional scale, multi-ownership context into local forest management and restoration. Meeting the region-wide restoration needs identified in this study will require a substantial increase in the pace and scale of restoration treatments and coordination amongst governments, agencies, and landowners. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Production of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) resistant to the chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) is being conducted currently through traditional breeding and genetic transformation. Sufficient material for field testing is currently available from The American Chestnut Foundation's backcross breeding program. We planted approximately 4500 chestnut seedlings into forest test plantings on three National Forests over three years, beginning in 2009. Early survival and growth was dependent on disease pressure from exotic pathogens, primarily, root rot caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi. Plantings that contained seedlings not exhibiting symptoms of this disease had high survival (>75%) and fast rates of height growth (0.5 m/yr). We documented other non-native pests negatively affecting chestnuts including Asiatic oak weevil (Cyrtepistomus castaneus) and the Asian chestnut gall wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus). Native pest problems included browsing of the terminal leader by deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and defoliation caused by the chestnut sawfly (Craesus castaneae). Restoration of American chestnut will require not only blight-resistance, but adaptation to forest environments with intense vegetation competition and strategies to address other native and exotic insects and pathogens.

AB  - American chestnut trees were an important source of timber in Connecticut until chestnut blight disease reduced them to understory shrubs. Breeding begun in 1930 has now produced trees with enough resistance to initiate field trials in the forest. Biological control by hypovirulence viruses is being used in the plots in an effort to keep native trees alive. If native trees cross with the planted trees with resistance, future generations should have increased resistance to chestnut blight disease and the genetic diversity of the population will be increased.

AB  - The Forest Health Initiative (FHI) was developed and implemented to test the hypothesis that a coordinated effort in biotechnology research could lead to resistant trees capable of restoring a species in a relevant time frame. As a test case, the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was chosen for study as it is an iconic forest tree species in the eastern United States and southeastern Canada that has been nearly extirpated by chestnut blight which is caused by an introduced fungal pathogen (Cryphonectria parasitica). In addition, the species has attracted research investments over many decades, leading to some promising possibilities for effecting restoration. The FHI, now completing its third year, has integrated genomics-based candidate gene discovery with robust clonal propagation and gene transformation systems capable of producing hundreds of independent events for dozens of genes per year. A promising early leaf assay for blight reaction has been developed that will be instrumental in screening the large amount of material in production through these systems. Regulatory permits for testing some of the earliest transgene events have been obtained as small-scale field testing is beginning. High density genetic maps and various mapping populations are being analyzed to gain additional insights into the specific genes found in quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistances to blight and Phytophthora root rot (caused by P. cinnamomi, also known as ink disease). Nearly complete genome sequences of three of the blight resistance QTLs have been determined. These sequences are greatly assisting these analyses, as have comparisons with peach and other completed plant genomes, demonstrating the power of comparative genomics. These results show great promise for meeting the challenge proposed by the FHI hypothesis for American chestnut. In addition, other forest tree species under threat should benefit from similarly designed initiatives.

AB  - Over the last 200. years, genetic resources of forest trees have been increasingly transferred, within and outside of species' native distribution ranges, for forestry and for research and development (R&D). Transferred germplasm has been deployed to grow trees for numerous purposes, ranging from the production of wood and non-wood products to the provision of ecosystem services such as the restoration of forests for biodiversity conservation. The oldest form of R&D, provenance trials, revealed early on that seed origin has a major influence on the performance of planted trees. International provenance trials have been essential for selecting seed sources for reforestation and for improving tree germplasm through breeding. Many tree breeding programmes were initiated in the 1950s, but as one round of testing and selection typically takes decades, the most advanced of them are only in their third cycle. Recent advances in forest genomics have increased the understanding of the genetic basis of different traits, but it is unlikely that molecular marker-assisted approaches will quickly replace traditional tree breeding methods. Furthermore, provenance trials and progeny tests are still needed to complement new research approaches. Currently, seed of boreal and temperate trees for reforestation purposes are largely obtained from improved sources. The situation is similar for fast growing tropical and subtropical trees grown in plantations, but in the case of tropical hardwoods and many agroforestry trees, only limited tested or improved seed sources are available. Transfers of tree germplasm involve some risks of spreading pests and diseases, of introducing invasive tree species and of polluting the genetic make-up of already present tree populations. Many of these risks have been underestimated in the past, but they are now better understood and managed. Relatively few tree species used for forestry have become invasive, and the risk of spreading pests and diseases while transferring seed is considerably lower than when moving live plants. The implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (ABS) may significantly change current transfer practices in the forestry sector by increasing transaction costs and the time needed to lawfully obtain forest genetic resources for R&D purposes. Many countries are likely to struggle to establish a well-functioning ABS regulatory system, slowing down the process of obtaining the necessary documentation for exchange. This is unfortunate, as climate change, outbreaks of pests and diseases, and continual pressure to support productivity, increase the need for transferring tree germplasm and accelerating R&D. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances such as mining for coal have caused significant disturbance to the Appalachian forests of North America. Recovery of these disturbances is highly dependent on restoration methods that encourage natural succession. Unfortunately, current reclamation protocols have resulted in soil compaction and aggressive herbaceous groundcovers that impede the recovery of native trees. To overcome this, methods such as deep ripping and plow and disking were applied to a reclaimed mine land in Ohio, USA Plantings of pure American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and two seedling types (BC1F3 and BC2F3) bred for resistance to chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) were assessed among different soil preparation treatments over five field seasons. Seedling mortality due to natural infection by chestnut blight was recorded and related to the disease resistance potential of the BC1F3 and BC2F3 seedlings. The growth and survival of chestnuts in plots that employed either ripping, plow disking, or the combination of the two methods were significantly greater than the control plots. After five seasons, differences existed among the soil treatments; plots that applied deep ripping had the highest survival and growth. When chestnut types were compared, pure American chestnut was the tallest. However, BC2F3 chestnut seedlings had the highest survival and lower disease incidence. Results suggest that employing deep ripping with backcrossed chestnut seedlings provides a method for establishing hardwood seedlings in soils impacted by surface mining. Planting methods that promote vigorous growth can be applied more broadly to other regions where anthropogenic disturbances create soil conditions that hinder seedling establishment. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Efforts to restore species threatened by introduced pathogens often include breeding resistance into susceptible native species from resistant exotics, but this is a lengthy and expensive process. Naturally occurring hybrids between susceptible and resistant species may accelerate this process if they fulfill the desired species’ ecological function. To explore this possibility, we exposed the following seedlings to drought and flood treatments in a controlled environment: Juglans cinerea L. (butternut), which has been devastated by an exotic pathogen; Juglans ailantifolia Carr. var. cordiformis (heartnut); Juglans × bixbyi Rehd. [ailanthifolia × cinerea] (buartnut), multigenerational hybrids between butternut and heartnut; and Juglans nigra L. (black walnut). There was a strong taxa × treatment interaction. Butternut had a negative response to flood treatments, expressed by reduced leaf area (LA), photosynthetic assimilation (A), and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm). Heartnut had a negative response to drought, expressed by lower LA and A. Hybrid A and LA were reduced in response to both treatments. Results indicate that hybrid drought and flood tolerance may limit their overall ability to completely occupy the ecological niche formerly filled by butternut. However, the strong dichotomous response of progenitors to moisture stress suggests that hybrids could be efficiently screened for J. cinerea character in conjunction with disease resistance. © 2014, National Research Council of Canada.

AB  - American chestnut (Castanea dentata) has been killed or reduced to recurrent stump sprouts throughout its range following the importation of multiple pathogens in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Understanding what drives chestnut growth and survival would aid the development of appropriate silvicultural guidelines for restoring the species once blight resistant stock is available. Here we compare the response of planted American and hybrid chestnut seedlings to that of important competitors, northern red oak (Quercus rubra), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (A. rubrum), under treatments designed to evaluate the effects of various sources of competition on seedling growth and survival. After four years, American and hybrid chestnut was significantly taller in trenched plots (181.8 ± 12.4. cm; mean ± SE) compared to untrenched plots (127.5 ± 7.9. cm), weeded plots (174.5 ± 12.7. cm) compared to unweeded plots (130.1 ± 6.5. cm) and in midstory removal plots (156.6 ± 7.8) versus full canopy (88.8 ± 11.7. cm), and had outperformed the other species in most competitive environments. Chestnut was the only species to respond to every treatment with significant growth increases, displaying a notable ability to capture growing space when it became available. We suggest that American chestnut restoration may be more successful where early stand management provides chestnut a brief period of reduced competition. Specifically, midstory removal can increase survival and growth of underplanted American chestnut, and when combined with multi-stage shelterwood removals of the overstory and some amount of competition control, may constitute a viable restoration strategy for chestnut in many of the eastern oak-hickory forests where it was originally dominant. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - American chestnut restoration depends on a multitude of biological, administrative, and technological factors. Germplasm traditionally bred for resistance to the chestnut blight disease caused by the exotic pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica has been deployed on national forests in the Eastern and Southern Regions of the National Forest System (NFS) since 2009. Trees were challenged by biological factors, primarily deer browse and ink disease (caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi). Because of these problems, inferences regarding resistance or tolerance to blight are premature. Mitigation to improve success includes improved technology in seedling production for planting and selection of appropriate test sites with limited management restrictions. We suggest that chestnut restoration within the USDA Forest Service be conducted through deployment of a series of long-term multidisciplinary tests. Limitations in resources required for this effort necessitate partnership building both within and outside the agency. Vegetation establishment targets that include chestnut test plantings within the NFS should be developed. © 2014, Society of American Foresters. All rights reserved.

AB  - National law and policy direct the management of the National Forests, with restoring resilient forest conditions being an overarching theme. Climate is a major driver of disturbances that affect ecosystems, especially those with vegetation that show large departures from historical conditions. Drought, fire, insects, and diseases are common forest stressors whose impacts are being exacerbated by climate change. These stressors are threatening the ecosystem services that people value in the forests of the northern Rocky Mountains. The forests of most concern are the dry ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, moist western white pine mixed with western larch, and cool lodgepole pine mixed with quaking aspen and whitebark pine. Potential reductions in some ecosystem services pose a challenge in terms of not only direct biophysical consequences but also social and economic values that flow from these forests. Values at risk include forest integrity, wildlife habitat, watershed condition, fish habitat, recreation opportunities and investments, community infrastructure, and public safety. This article describes a decision support tool developed by the USDA Forest Service Northern Region in 2010 to support integrated restoration planning. The Northern Region’s Integrated Restoration and Protection Strategy (IRPS) is premised on identifying historical conditions through application of the natural range of variability, comparing them with current conditions, and considering a broader range of future issues, including climate change. The IRPS assists managers in the complex task of evaluating factors that influence national forest planning efforts. The assessment and IRPS, by integrating ecological, social, and economic considerations, will help managers of national forests prioritize restoration opportunities using increasingly scarce financial resources. The IRPS will be most beneficial when associated with planning silvicultural practices and fire management directed at restoring the forests of the Northern Region to a more resilient condition. © 2014, Society of American Foresters.

AB  - Natural environments offer a high potential for human well-being, restoration and stress recovery in terms of allostatic load. A growing body of literature is investigating psychological and physiological health benefits of contact with Nature. So far, a synthesis of physiological health outcomes of direct outdoor nature experiences and its potential for improving Public Health is missing. We were interested in summarizing the outcomes of studies that investigated physiological outcomes of experiencing Nature measuring at least one physiological parameter during the last two decades. Studies on effects of indoor or simulated Nature exposure via videos or photos, animal contact, and wood as building material were excluded from further analysis. As an online literature research delivered heterogeneous data inappropriate for quantitative synthesis approaches, we descriptively summarized and narratively synthesized studies. The procedure started with 1,187 titles. Research articles in English language published in international peer-reviewed journals that investigated the effects of natural outdoor environments on humans by were included. We identified 17 relevant articles reporting on effects of Nature by measuring 20 different physiological parameters. We assigned these parameters to one of the four body systems brain activity, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and immune function. These studies reported mainly direct and positive effects, however, our analyses revealed heterogeneous outcomes regarding significance of results. Most of the studies were conducted in Japan, based on quite small samples, predominantly with male students as participants in a cross-sectional design. In general, our narrative review provided an ambiguous illustration of the effects outdoor nature exerted on physiological parameters. However, the majority of studies reported significant positive effects. A harmonizing effect of Nature, especially on physiological stress reactions, was found across all body systems. From a Public Health perspective, interdisciplinary work on utilizing benefits of Nature regarding health promotion, disease prevention, and nature-based therapy should be optimized in order to eventually diminish given methodological limitations from mono-disciplinary studies. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Backcross breeding programs have been used to transfer disease resistance and other traits from one forest tree species to another in order to meet restoration objectives. Evaluating the field performance of such material is critical for determining the success of breeding programs. In eastern North America, The American Chestnut Foundation has a backcross breeding program that uses Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) to introduce resistance of the fungal pathogen chestnut blight [Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr.] to the native American chestnut [Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.]. We compared physiological and morphological characteristics among seedlings of American chestnut, Chinese chestnut, and BC1F3, BC2F3, and BC3F3 hybrid chestnuts during their fourth growing season after field-planting. American chestnut and the BC3F3 breeding generation displayed photosynthetic light-response curves that were similar to each other but different from Chinese chestnut. Rates of photosynthesis were higher for American chestnut and the BC3F3 breeding generation when compared to Chinese chestnut for light levels ≥800 μmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density and for maximum photosynthetic capacity. Leaf morphology variables were not different between American chestnut and any of the breeding generations, but leaf area (on a per leaf basis) of Chinese chestnut was lower than that of any other chestnut type. Our results suggest that backcross breeding can be used to transfer desirable traits for restoration of native species threatened by non-native pathogens. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - With growing concerns over the serious ecological problems in pine forests (Pinus massoniana, P. thunbergii) caused by the invasion of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (the pine wood nematode), a particular challenge is to determine the succession and restoration of damaged pine forests in Asia. We used two-way indicator species analysis and canonical correlation analysis for the hierarchical classification of existing secondary forests that have been restored since the invasion of B. xylophilus 18 years ago. Biserial correlation analysis was used to relate the spatial distribution of species to environmental factors. After 18 years of natural recovery, the original pine forest had evolved into seven types of secondary forest. Seven environmental factors, namely soil depth, humus depth, soil pH, aspect, slope position, bare rock ratio, and distance to the sea, were significantly correlated with species distribution. Furthermore, we proposed specific reform measures and suggestions for the different types of secondary forest formed after the damage and identified the factors driving the various forms of restoration. These results suggest that it is possible to predict the restoration paths of damaged pine forests, which would reduce the negative impact of B. xylophilus invasions. © The Author 2014.

AB  - With the transport of plants around the globe, exotic species can readily spread disease to their native relatives; however, they can also provide genetic resistance to those relatives through hybrid breeding programmes. American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was an abundant tree species in North America until its decimation by introduced chestnut blight. To restore chestnut in North America, efforts are ongoing to test putative blight-resistant hybrids of Castanea dentata and Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima), but little is known about the ecology of C. mollissima. In a forest in northeastern USA in which C. mollissima has become established, we explored questions of stand dynamics, health and genetic relationships of C. mollissima offspring to an adjacent parent orchard.We found that C. mollissima was adapted and randomly distributed among native species in this relatively young forest. The genetics of the C. mollissima population compared with its parents indicated little effect of selection pressure as each of the parent trees contributed at least one offspring. The ease with which this exotic species proliferated calls to questionwhy C.mollissima is rare elsewhere in forests of North America. It is likely that a timewindowof lowanimal predation allowed seedlings to establish, and the shallow soil at this site limited the maximum forest canopy height, permitting the characteristically short-statured C. mollissima to avoid suppression. Our results indicate that because C. mollissima exhibited pioneer species characteristics, hybrids between C. mollissima and C. dentata have the potential to be successful pioneer species of future forests in North America, and we challenge the paradigmthat exotic tree species are wholly detrimental to native biodiversity.We contend that exotic tree species should be assessed not only by their level of threat to native species, but also by their potential positive impacts on ecosystems via hybrid breeding programmes.

Genetic resistance within the host species is the first line of defense for tree species. Resistance breeding programs for the native fusiform rust and exotic (to North America) white pine blister rust diseases are two of the longest concerted efforts in forest trees, spanning more than 50 years. Advances in developing greater genetic resistance have been made in both pathosystems, but unique challenges and opportunities in each system translate to different approaches. Fusiform rust resistance programs have mainly emphasized complete resistance, while partial resistance plays a prominent role in white pine blister rust resistance programs. Advances in the development of molecular genetic tools now permit investigations in conifers and their associated rust pathogens. Good progress has been made in identifying resistant populations and understanding resistance in these pathosystems, and resistant stock is now being used extensively for reforestation and restoration. These programs represent great success stories brought to fruition by the long-term efforts. However, continued support will be needed to enhance the level and fully realize the potential of durable genetic resistance in these invaluable North American conifer species. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Partial canopy cover promotes regeneration of many ecologically and/or economically favoured tree species in temperate mesic forests. However, the specific effects of belowground resource competition from different canopystrata in these systems are poorly understood. This is particularly the case for American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) a formerly dominant forest tree species in eastern North America that was functionally extirpated from the canopy by an exotic blight disease and for which there is now increased interest in forest restoration using blight-resistant backcross hybrids. We examined the influence of overstory and herbaceous root competition (via trenching or weeding) on growth and survival of 3-year-old, underplanted American chestnut and northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) seedlings following midstory removal. Leaf physiology was evaluated on American chestnut throughout the third growing season. Compared with northern red oak, American chestnut had greater relative aboveground growth and its relative growth was more responsive to the removal of overstory root competition. American chestnut had greater instantaneous water use efficiency in the absence of overstory root competition. Herbaceous root competition had no effect on seedling growth of either species. Thus, in lowlight conditions typical of an incomplete canopy, overstory root competition and not herbaceous competition limited American chestnut seedling growth and physiological development during establishment. © 2014 Institute of Chartered Foresters.

AB  - Mangroves are critical ecosystems given their key role in conserving biodiversity, protecting coastlines from erosion and supporting coastal resources. They may be impacted by oil and gas activities, either directly or indirectly. Restoring them is therefore of prime importance. In the Mahakam Delta (East Kalimantan, Indonesia), oil and gas exploration and production have been conducted for more than 40 years. This industry has operated in a quasi-pristine area barely affected by human activities until the mid 80's. Toward the late 1980's and until 2000, the delta was subject to massive and rapid development of shrimp farming and by 2001, 85% of the delta mangroves were destroyed and most of it replaced by ponds used for aquaculture. By the end of 1990's, shrimp farm productivity in the delta decreased due to a lack of nutrients in ponds and the occurrence of shrimp diseases. Numerous ponds were abandoned in the delta. This economic situation generated social instabilities that could threaten the oil and gas industry in the region. Therefore, in order to better protect mangroves and optimize restoration of damaged areas, Total E&P Indonesie embarked on a mangrove restoration initiative of the Mahakam Delta aimed at understanding and contributing to the restoration processes through both natural recolonization and planting techniques. The general methodology implemented has been to i) describe the land cover using satellite imagery, interpreting aerial photos, conducting field work, and establishing GIS maps, ii) inventory the fauna and flora (including mangroves, birds, mammals, reptiles), iii) monitoring the naturally re-colonized areas, replanted areas and original forest in selected areas. Results show that natural recolonization of a mangrove area can be very quick under certain conditions (subject to availability of seeds and easy access of seeds to the area to be recolonized). But in areas where seeds cannot easily move, or where seed supply is scarce, replanting remains the best option. Social aspects have also to be taken into account given that replanting can promote the local commitment to sustainable environmental conservation. Copyright 2014 , Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - The major task of policy makers and practitioners when confronted with a resource management problem is to decide on the potential solution(s) to adopt from a range of available options. However, this process is unlikely to be successful and cost effective without access to an independently verified and comprehensive available list of options. There is currently burgeoning interest in ecosystem services and quantitative assessments of their importance and value. Recognition of the value of ecosystem services to human well-being represents an increasingly important argument for protecting and restoring the natural environment, alongside the moral and ethical justifications for conservation. As well as understanding the benefits of ecosystem services, it is also important to synthesize the practical interventions that are capable of maintaining and/or enhancing these services. Apart from pest regulation, pollination, and global climate regulation, this type of exercise has attracted relatively little attention. Through a systematic consultation exercise, we identify a candidate list of 296 possible interventions across the main regulating services of air quality regulation, climate regulation, water flow regulation, erosion regulation, water purification and waste treatment, disease regulation, pest regulation, pollination and natural hazard regulation. The range of interventions differs greatly between habitats and services depending upon the ease of manipulation and the level of research intensity. Some interventions have the potential to deliver benefits across a range of regulating services, especially those that reduce soil loss and maintain forest cover. Synthesis and applications: Solution scanning is important for questioning existing knowledge and identifying the range of options available to researchers and practitioners, as well as serving as the necessary basis for assessing cost effectiveness and guiding implementation strategies. We recommend that it become a routine part of decision making in all environmental policy areas. © 2014 by the author(s).

AB  - Iron tailings are the wastes discharged after selecting the useful components from the grinded ore in dressing plants. The chemical composition mainly comprised iron, silicon, magnesium, calcium, aluminum, as well as a small amount of phosphorus, sulfur etc. Iron tailings are the special matrices with barren soil nutrients. A metal mine waste tailing dump is a typical degenerative ecosystem. Owing to their bad characteristics on the physical chemistry, the waste tailing dumps are going to become infertile lands generally. The wastes, such as tailings and acid mine wastewater produced during the ore dressing, not only destroy and occupy a lot of land resources but also result in serious pollution of the soil and water resources. Therefore, the research related to mining ecological restoration has become a focus. Phytoremediation is the key method for mining ecological restoration. Soil microorganism is the absolutely necessary biological factor on improving the soil environment and on further vegetation restoration in iron tailing dumps. There is a correlation between the microorganism quantity, its enzyme activity and the soil nutrient content. Some efficient native azotobacteria are able to accommodate and improve the particular iron tailings conditions, promote the soil microbe enzyme activity and activate the mineral nutrients in the soil. Azotobacteria can promote the absorption of nutrients in plant root system, enhance the host plant disease resistance and other stress resistances, and improve the soil structure. Of the microorganisms, azotobacteria are the dominant population in soils. It is possible to screen and isolate some efficient azotobacteria in the iron tailings. However, there have not been any publications of azobobacteria in the iron tailings. Moreover, the kinds of and their ability of nitrogen fixation are affected by plants, revegetation modes and site conditions. In the paper, the iron tailings soils were used for screening, isolating, analyzing of enzyme activity and Biolog identifying of azotobacteria. Soil samples were taken from the direct vegetation restoration forest (Sabina vulgaris forest, Amorpha fruticosa forest, Populus tomentosa forest and multi species mingled forest), the vegetation restoration forest via water and soil conservation engineering measures, the vegetation restoration forest via artificial afforestation construction, and the forest soils from different slope direction site conditions. It is the foundation for understanding the interaction mechanism between azotobacteria and host plants, and the tailings remediation mechanism. It is the base for trees selection of reforestation in iron tailings, and helpful for the improvement and development of mining areas. Acetylene reduction method was used to determine nitrogen-fixation activity of azotobacteria. Molecular nitrogen is reduced to ammonia by nitrogenase. Some compounds with N-N,N{box drawings double horizontal}O, C{box drawings double horizontal}N and C{box drawings double horizontal}C bond also can be reduced by nitrogenase. The nitrogenase activity is analyzed according to the diversity of nitrogenase substrates. The process of acetylene being reduced to methane by nitrogenase can be quickly checked by gas chromatography simply and sensitively. The indirect determination method of nitrogenase activity has been widely applied. In order to obtain efficient native azotobacteria for iron tailings recovery, high-efficiency azotobacteria were screened by a nitrogen-free selective medium from tailing samples of different recovery modes, and the nitrogenase activities of the 48 strains isolated were measured by acetylene reduction. Db1, Ec1 with high nitrogenase activity screened from 48 strains by acetylene reduction, were identified as Azotobacteria by Biolog analysis, and their nitrogenase specific activities were 203.20 nmol·m g-·1 h-1 and 307.23 nmol·m g-·1 h-1 respectively. The numbers of strain were affected by different recovery modes, species diversity, slope direction of tailings and engineering measures. More strains with higher nigrogenase activity can be obtained from soils of the sample plots which covered by plants for longer time, or located in the sunny slope of tailings, or adopted artificial mixed forests, or with the engineering measures of six holes brick and slope plantation.

AB  - Climate change resulted in changes in crop growth duration and planting structure, northward movement of planting region, and more severe plant diseases and insect pests in Northwest China. It caused earlier seeding for spring crop, later seeding for autumn crop, accelerated crop growth, and reduced mortality for winter crop. To adapt to climate change, measures such as optimization of agricultural arrangement, adjustment of planting structure, expansion of thermophilic crops, and development of water-saving agriculture have been taken. Damaging consequences of imbalance between grassland and livestock were enhanced. The deterioration trend of grassland was intensified; both grass quantity and quality declined. With overgrazing, proportions of inferior grass, weeds and poisonous weeds increased in plateau pastoral areas. Returning farmland to grazing, returning grazing to grassland, fence enclosure and artificial grassland construction have been implemented to restore the grassland vegetation, to increase the grassland coverage, to reasonably control the livestock carrying capacity, to prevent overgrazing, to keep balance between grassland and livestock, and to develop the ecological animal husbandry. In Northwest China, because the amount of regional water resources had an overall decreasing trend, there was a continuous expansion in the regional land desertification, and soil erosion was very serious. A series of measures, such as development of artificial precipitation (snow), water resources control, regional water diversion, water storage project and so on, were used effectively to respond to water deficit. It had played a certain role in controlling soil erosion by natural forest protection and returning farmland to forest and grassland. In the early 21st century, noticeable achievements had been made in prevention and control of desertification in Northwest China. The regional ecological environment has been improved obviously, and the desertification trend has shown sign of under control.

AB  - A 2-year-old female ovariectomised Norwegian Forest cat with a history of post-spaying urinary incontinence was diagnosed with acquired urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence (USMI) after complete clinical and laboratory examination. Although there is no literature regarding the treatment of post-spaying USMI in cats, deslorelin acetate is successful in the treatment of post-spaying USMI in dogs. Deslorelin acetate implants have been shown previously to be effective for contraception and oestrus suppression in queens, and suppression of reproductive function in tomcats. Therefore, deslorelin acetate implant treatment was chosen for treatment of post-spaying USMI in this queen. Follow-up examinations were performed on days 8, 15 and 30 after deslorelin implant insertion. Urinary continence was restored about 25 days after implantation and maintained for at least 15 months, without treatment-related negative effects. In the present case report, the post-spaying urinary incontinence related to the acquired USMI was successfully treated with a deslorelin acetate implant. In addition, safe implantation was easy in cats and the single injection resulted in long-lasting efficacy. Further studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of deslorelin acetate treatment for post-spaying USMI in queens and to better delineate the duration of efficacy. © ISFM and AAFP 2013.

AB  - Over the last two decades, ash dieback has become a major problem in Europe, where the causative fungus has invaded the continent rapidly. The disease is caused by the invasive pathogenic fungus Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (anamorph Chalara fraxinea), which causes severe symptoms and dieback in common ash, Fraxinus excelsior. It is becoming a significant threat to biodiversity in forest ecosystems and the economic and aesthetic impacts are immense. Despite the presence of the disease for at least 10 years in Scandinavia, a small fraction of F. excelsior trees have remained vigorous, and these trees exhibit no or low levels of symptoms even where neighbouring trees are very sick. This gives hope that a fraction of the ash trees will retain a sufficiently viable growth to survive. Following a period of high mortality in natural populations, selection and breeding of remaining viable ash trees could therefore provide a route for restoring the role of ash in the landscape. This paper reviews the available data on disease dissemination, and the consequences thereof in terms of symptom severity and mortality, and appraises studies that have tested the hypothesis that less-affected trees have genetically based resistance. The implications of the results for the adaptive potential of common ash to respond to the disease through natural or assisted selection are discussed. The risks of adverse fitness effects of population fragmentation due to high mortality are considered. Finally, it is recommended that resistant trees (genotypes) should be selected to facilitate conservation of the species. © 2014 British Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - This article charts the history of an unusual approach taken to restoring the American chestnut to its native range between 1955 and 1980. The chestnut, once abundant in the eastern United States, had been nearly wiped out by a blight to which it had little resistance. In 1955 the geneticist W. Ralph Singleton proposed that exposing chestnuts to radiation might produce trees carrying a genetic mutation for blight resistance. These could then be used to breed many more resistant trees, which would in turn be used for forest restoration. This effort undoubtedly originated in postwar atomic enthusiasm, yet as I argue here, it appealed for still other reasons, which explain why it persisted long after such enthusiasm had faded. Radiation-induced mutation offered a promising technological solution derived from recent genetics research that would address specific challenges of breeding blight-resistant chestnuts. In particular, it offered a speedy alternative to hybridization with Asian trees, a long process seen to diminish the desired qualities of the American chestnut and its integrity as a species. By exploring this confluence of nuclear technology, genetics, and species restoration, and placing it in the longer history of chestnut restoration efforts, this article highlights more broadly the challenges that emerge when saving a species requires significant human intervention and especially genetic manipulation. © 2014 The Author .

AB  - The abundance of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) has been significantly reduced across its distribution range over the past few centuries. The species' regeneration dynamics is well documented in the centre of its range, but is poorly understood at the northern limit of continuous distribution. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified natural white pine regeneration in unmanaged mature stands, identified the most important variables influencing it, and evaluated the impact of damaging agents, namely white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch.), white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck), and herbivory. We also quantified the influence of remnant stands and residual trees on the spatial distribution of regeneration in logged sites. The results reveal continuous but low recruitment in mature stands. The basal area of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Miller) had a strong negative effect on white pine regeneration. Regeneration was more abundant than expected on moister substrates, including moss, decaying wood and organic matter. White pine regeneration was noted in recently logged areas, where distance from remnant stands had a significant effect on the abundance of white pine regeneration. The northern limit of continuous distribution holds potential for white pine restoration, for example by preserving remnant white pine stands that can provide seed sources for natural regeneration in a shelterwood cut system, or in adjacent clearcut areas. This study illustrates that different management strategies should be used near northern range limits, where effects of site conditions and disturbance agents are different than in the center of a species' range. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Restoration of old-growth forest structure is an emerging silvicultural goal, especially in those regions where old-growth abundance falls below the historic range of variability. However, longitudinal studies of old-growth dynamics that can inform silvicultural and policy options are few. We analyzed the change in structure, including stand density, diameter distribution, and the abundance of large live, standing dead, and downed dead trees on 58 late-successional and old-growth plots in Maine, USA, and compared these to regional data from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis program. Structural dynamics on the late-successional plots reflected orderly change associated with density-dependent growth and mortality, but dynamics on the old-growth plots were more variable. Some plots experienced heavy mortality associated with beech bark disease. Diameter distributions conformed poorly to a classic exponential distribution, and did not converge toward such a distribution at the plot scale. Although large live trees showed a broad trend of increasing density in regional forests, recent harvesting patterns offset a considerable fraction of those gains, while mean diameter was static and the number of large dead trees was weakly declining. Even though forests of the northeast are aging, changes in silviculture and forest policy are necessary to accelerate restoration of old-growth structure. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - Ethnic people conserved the biodiversity in and around localities of their natural habitat since the beginnings of civilization. Plants are conserved by these ethnic and indigenous people that serve as a source of wild edible food in the form of roots, tubers, rhizomes, seeds, fruits and as agricultural and horticultural plants. Some of the indigenous cultivars conserved by these ethnic people are used in agricultural cultivars improvement programmes to increase productivity and incorporate traits for increasing resistance against different pests and diseases. Plants are conserved in abandoned sites of shifting agriculture by tribals and also in sacred groves as in situ conservation of biodiversity and ecological restoration. An attempt have been made to analyze the role of indigenous knowledge system, belief and sacred groves of tribals of India in conservation of forest.

AB  - Summary: Government policies are driving landscape-scale changes in land use to provide ecosystem services; but there may be unconsidered cascading effects. A major land use change targeted for regulating climate and biodiversity is peatland restoration. This will cause changes in vegetation and, potentially, keystone species such as large herbivores, which are the main hosts to Ixodes ricinus (L.) ticks, the most important vector of disease-causing pathogens in Europe. This study tested the impact of restoring peatlands from conifer forestry on Ixodes ricinus abundance and explored the likely mechanisms. Large-scale surveys of Ixodes ricinus, vertebrate herbivores and vegetation were conducted in adjacent areas of forest, bog and areas felled 5-13 years previously. Questing tick abundance was greatest in forest and almost absent from blanket bog, with intermediate numbers in felled areas, where ticks were more abundant in young than in old felled areas. The likely mechanisms for these variations in tick abundance were deer habitat preferences (bog was the least preferred habitat) and ground vegetation height or canopy cover, which are generally associated with alternative tick hosts and micro-climates that aid tick questing and survival. Synthesis and applications. Felling conifer forest to restore peatlands could produce a dramatic decline in tick abundance throughout the restoration process, with implications for disease risk. Therefore, a further ecosystem service of peatlands in addition to climate, biodiversity and water regulation is regulating pests and disease. Deer management and procedures that speed up the restoration process are likely to enhance the effect during the intermediate stages.

AB  - To mitigate the loss of native tree species threatened by non-native pathogens, managers need to better understand the conservation status of remaining populations and the conditions that favor successful regeneration. Populations of Juglans cinerea L. (butternut), a wide-ranging riparian species, have been devastated by butternut canker, a disease caused by a non-native fungal pathogen. We assessed J. cinerea within Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) to determine post-disease survivorship and health, recruitment history, environmental conditions associated with survival, and the extent of hybridization with a non-native congener. Monitoring records were used to locate and collect data for 207 J. cinerea trees in 19 watersheds. Tree cores were collected from a subset of individuals to assess recruitment history. We sampled vegetation plots within areas that contained J. cinerea to assess site conditions and overstory species composition of characteristic habitat. We collected leaf samples for genetic analysis to determine the frequency of hybridization. Our reassessment of monitoring records suggests that J. cinerea abundance in GSMNP has declined due to butternut canker and thirty years of poor regeneration. Populations displayed continuous recruitment following Park establishment (1934) until around 1980, after which regeneration declined drastically. Ordination analysis revealed that J. cinerea in the contemporary forest was associated with greater distance from homesites and reduced basal area of competing species. Hybrids comprised a small portion of sampled trees. The presence of healthy trees and low rate of hybridization suggest that these trees may contribute to the development of disease-resistant genotypes for future restoration efforts.

AB  - Summary: This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Pulmonaria officinalis L. (Common Lungwort) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Pulmonaria officinalis is a distylous, perennial rosette hemicryptophyte that is naturalized in Britain. It occurs predominantly in the understory of broadleaved, mixed, open woods rich in hornbeam, beech and oak, but is has also been recorded from hedges, banks alongside streams, (sunken) roadsides, built-up areas, gardens, rubbish tips, yew woodland and, less frequently, coniferous woodland. Its native range stretches from southern Sweden, in the north, to northern Italy, in the south, and from western Germany to Poland and Lithuania. It is most common in central Europe. Pulmonaria officinalis reproduces both by sexual and vegetative means. The underground parts consist of a slowly creeping rhizome with adventitious roots. Despite the presence of an elaiosome that is attractive to ants that likely facilitates seed dispersal, populations often show a significant fine-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood sizes. The leaves and flowering stalks are covered in hairs of varied length and stiffness, and stems and inflorescences are sparsely covered with glandular hairs. Flowers of P. officinalis are heterostylous, with distinct pin and thrum morphs. The corolla varies from purple, violet or blue to shades of pink and red, or sometimes white. The flowers are mainly pollinated by solitary bees and bumblebees. Pulmonaria officinalis has significantly expanded its distribution in the British Isles since the 18th century, especially in southern England. P. officinalis is currently not regarded as threatened in Europe. Nonetheless, small, isolated populations of the species often show reduced reproductive success and lower genetic diversity, potentially affecting their long-term survival. Preservation of local habitat conditions by regular opening of the forest canopy and restoration of gene flow among populations are required to maintain viable populations of P. officinalis in the long term. © 2013 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Forest systems are increasingly threatened by emergent, exotic diseases, yet management strategies for forest trees may be hindered by long generation times and scant background knowledge. We tested whether nursery disease resistance and growth traits have predictive value for the conservation of Notholithocarpus densiflorus, the host most susceptible to sudden oak death. We established three experimental populations to assess nursery growth and resistance to Phytophthora ramorum, and correlations between nursery-derived breeding values with seedling survival in a field disease trial. Estimates of nursery traits' heritability were low to moderate, with lowest estimates for resistance traits. Within the field trial, survival likelihood was increased in larger seedlings and decreased with the development of disease symptoms. The seed-parent family wide likelihood of survival was likewise correlated with family predictors for size and resistance to disease in 2nd year laboratory assays, though not resistance in 1st year leaf assays. We identified traits and seedling families with increased survivorship in planted tanoaks, and a framework to further identify seed parents favored for restoration. The additive genetic variation and seedling disease dynamics we describe hold promise to refine current disease models and expand the understanding of evolutionary dynamics of emergent infectious diseases in highly susceptible hosts. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Pyranocycloartobiloxanthone A (PA), a xanthone derived from the Artocarpus obtusus Jarret, belongs to the Moraceae family which is native to the tropical forest of Malaysia. In this study, the efficacy of PA as a gastroprotective compound was examined against ethanol-induced ulcer model in rats. The rats were pretreated with PA and subsequently exposed to acute gastric lesions induced by absolute ethanol. The ulcer index, gastric juice acidity, mucus content, histological analysis, glutathione (GSH) levels, malondialdehyde level (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and non-protein sulfhydryl group (NP-SH) contents were evaluated in vivo. The activities of PA as anti-Helicobacter pylori, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor and free radical scavenger were also investigated in vitro. The results showed that the oral administration of PA protects gastric mucosa from ethanol-induced gastric lesions. PA pretreatment significantly (p < 0.05) restored the depleted GSH, NP-SH and NO levels in the gastric homogenate. Moreover, PA significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the elevated MDA level due to ethanol administration. The gastroprotective effect of PA was associated with an over expression of HSP70 and suppression of Bax proteins in the ulcerated tissue. In addition, PA exhibited a potent FRAP value and significant COX-2 inhibition. It also showed a significant minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against H. pylori bacterium. The efficacy of PA was accomplished safely without the presence of any toxicological parameters. The results of the present study indicate that the gastroprotective effect of PA might contribute to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well as the anti-apoptotic mechanism and antibacterial action against Helicobacter pylori. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Densities of abalone in southern California have been dramatically reduced by overfishing and disease, leading to the collapse of some populations, and low fertilization rates may be hindering population recovery. This is a pattern typical of abalone species globally. However, movement may produce clustered distributions that promote fertilization success in broadcast spawners, such as abalone, even at low regional densities. We translocated wild, adult pink abalone Haliotis corrugata to an existing pink abalone patch to create a high-density aggregation, and then used acoustic telemetry to characterize abalone movement and monitor aggregation maintenance for a period of 14 mo in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, California. Abalone showed a minimal flight response to handling that did not differ between the resident or translocated groups. Most individuals exhibited small home ranges (median area 183 m2) and homing behavior consisting of regular back-and-forth movement to a single point. Nomadic movement was also observed in several individuals. Though site fidelity may help maintain aggregations, abalone density decreased, and nearest neighbor distances increased at our site to nearinitial levels after 18 mo via a combination of mortality, large movements of a few individuals, and small, incremental movements of most individuals. No coordinated movements that would suggest spawning behavior were observed. Translocation of wild abalone to produce aggregations may not result in high rates of fertilization success that promote population recovery. However, the homing behavior observed may provide more opportunities for mating than expectations based on static measures of density and aggregation state. © Inter-Research 2013.

AB  - In mountainous regions, forests play a crucial role in protecting the local population from natural hazards. In cases where existing forests are destroyed, e.g. by wind throws or diseases, the protection function has to be restored through technical measures. To determine the willingness to pay (WTP) for protection against avalanches, a choice experiment has been conducted and different experiment specifications have been tested to determine possible impacts on the results. The present study contributes to a comprehensive assessment of protection measures, and helps to identify efficient solutions based on the judgement of the people potentially endangered by natural hazards. The stepwise approach has the advantage to gradually check data fit, thereby didactically showing an operational way of dealing with different model specifications. The detailed case study can serve as a manual for conducting choice experiments with a similar focus and demonstrates the suitability and caveats of this approach to value protection from natural hazards in general. © 2013 Author(s).

AB  - Enrichment planting within established plantations or secondary forests is a common strategy to enhance forest recovery, given that later successional forest species tend to have low dispersal and limited recruitment into these sites. It is difficult, however, to predict how species of seedlings will perform when planted under different overstory species. The field of phylogenetic ecology offers tools to help guide the selection of seedlings, drawing on the evolutionary conservatism of important functional traits. We evaluated the survival, growth, foliar disease, and herbivory of various native tropical tree seedlings at different evolutionary distances from monospecific stands of trees beneath which they were planted. We expected that seedlings planted under conspecific overstory trees would have low survival and growth and high percent foliar damage (as predicted by the Janzen-Connell Hypothesis), and that seedling performance would improve steadily with phylogenetic distance between seedling and overstory species. We found that seedlings planted under conspecific canopies had lower survivorship, reduced growth, and greater foliar damage than seedlings planted under canopies of different tree species. An overall increase in seedling performance with greater phylogenetic distance between seedling and overstory species was dominated by the contrast in performance between conspecific pairs and seedlings planted beneath extra-familial overstory species; but lack of available congeneric pairing limited inference about interactions among close relatives. Most pathogenic fungi isolated from enrichment-planted seedlings also caused disease when inoculated on the overstory tree species where the seedlings had been planted; this is consistent with overstory trees being an important reservoir of pathogens that affect seedlings. We conclude that enrichment planting with species more distantly related to those that dominate the canopy should enhance seedling's performance. Closer analysis at the congeneric level is warranted because of expected strong biotic interactions at close phylogenetic distances. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aims: Wilderness and other natural areas are threatened by large-scale disturbances (e. g., wildfire), air pollution, climate change, exotic diseases or pests, and a combination of these stress factors (i. e., stress complexes). Linville Gorge Wilderness (LGW) is one example of a high elevation wilderness in the southern Appalachian region that has been subject to stress complexes including chronic acidic deposition and several wildfires, varying in intensity and extent. Soils in LGW are inherently acidic with low base cation concentrations and decades of acidic deposition have contributed to low pH, based saturation, and Ca:Al ratio. We hypothesized that wildfires that occurred in LGW followed by liming burned areas would accelerate the restoration of acidic, nutrient depleted soils. Because soils at LGW had extremely low concentrations of exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+ dolomitic lime was applied to further boost these cations. We evaluated the effectiveness of dolomitic lime application in restoring exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+ and subsequently increasing pH and Ca:Al ratio of soils and making Ca and Mg available to recovering vegetation. Methods: Five treatment areas were established: severely burned twice (2000 &amp; 2007) with dolomitic lime application (2xSBL); moderately burned twice with lime application (2xMBL); severely burned twice, unlimed (2xSB); moderately burned once (2000), unlimed (1xMB); and a reference area (REF; unburned, unlimed). In 2008 and 2009, we measured overstory, understory, and ground-layer vegetation; forest floor mass and nutrients; and soil and soil solution chemistry within each treatment area. Results: All wildfire burned sites experienced substantial overstory mortality. However, understory biomass doubled between sample years on the most recently burned sites due to the rapid regrowth of ericaceous shrubs and prolific sprouting of deciduous trees. Burning followed by lime application (2xSBL and 2xMBL) significantly increased shallow soil solution NO3-N, but we found no soil solution NO3-N response to burning alone (2xSB and 1xMB). Surface soil base saturation and exchangeable Ca2+ were significantly affected by liming; Ca2+ concentrations were greater on 2xMBL and 2xSBL than 2xSB, 1xMB and REF. There was a smaller difference due to moderate burning along with greater soil Ca2+ on 1xMB compared to REF, but no difference between 2xSB and REF. Surface and subsurface soil exchangeable Al3+ were lower on 2xSBL than 2xSB, 2xMBL, 1xMB, and REF. Liming decreased soil acidity somewhat as surface soil pH was higher on the two burned sites with lime (pH = 3. 8) compared to 2xSB without lime (pH = 3. 6). Conclusions: Liming resulted in decreased soil Al3+ on 2xSBL coupled with increased soil Ca2+ on both 2xSBL and 2xMBL, which improved soil Ca/Al ratios. However, the soil Ca/Al ratio response was transitory, as exchangeable Al3+ increased and Ca/Al ratio decreased over time. Higher lime application rates may be necessary to obtain a substantial and longer-term improvement of cation-depleted soils at LGW. © 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).

AB  - To advance our restricted knowledge on mosquito biodiversity and distribution in Belgium, a national inventory started in 2007 (MODIRISK) based on a random selection of 936 collection points in three main environmental types: urban, rural and natural areas. Additionally, 64 sites were selected because of the risk of importing a vector or pathogen in these sites. Each site was sampled once between May and October 2007 and once in 2008 using Mosquito Magnet Liberty Plus traps. Diversity in pre-defined habitat types was calculated using three indices. The association between species and environmental types was assessed using a correspondence analysis. Twenty-three mosquito species belonging to traditionally recognized genera were found, including 21 indigenous and two exotic species. Highest species diversity (Simpson 0.765) and species richness (20 species) was observed in natural areas, although urban sites scored also well (Simpson 0.476, 16 species). Four clusters could be distinguished based on the correspondence analysis. The first one is related to human modified landscapes (such as urban, rural and industrial sites). A second is composed of species not associated with a specific habitat type, including the now widely distributed Anopheles plumbeus. A third group includes species commonly found in restored natural or bird migration areas, and a fourth cluster is composed of forest species. Outcomes of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed sampling scheme and support the choice of the trap type. Obtained results of this first country-wide inventory of the Culicidae in Belgium may serve as a basis for risk assessment of emerging mosquito-borne diseases.

AB  - Coniferous species with emergent growth forms can have positive influences on biological diversity and ecosystem function in temperate deciduous forests, but conifer populations have declined in some regions of mixed forest because of human activities. Restoration of midtolerant conifers can be especially difficult in mesic, late-successional forests without intensive treatments. The goal of this study was to quantify the effect of stand and site characteristics on the growth and competitive success of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) regeneration after gap-based restoration treatments in mesic hemlock-hardwood forests. We measured growth rates and competitive status of white pines averaging 7-15years of age that had been underplanted or naturally established in small canopy openings (mean expanded gap size ranging from 50 to 2200m2) in 14 hemlock-hardwood stands in northern Wisconsin, USA. Mortality of planted seedlings was very high, and few sites had more than 20% of the surviving pine saplings meeting established success criteria (relative height &gt;80%, or relative height &gt;50% and relative growth rate &gt;100%) compared to understory-gap competitors. However, six sites had some pines up to 3-5m tall, with height growth rates exceeding 30cm/year. Height growth was linearly correlated with light intensity but not strongly correlated with gap size. Fast-growing pines were generally found in locations with &gt;35% transmitted radiation and on sites lacking a well-developed understory of shade-tolerant species. Browse and disease damage did not appear to have a strong impact on current white pine growth and competitive status but may have contributed to high mortality rates in the first few years. Restoration of white pine in canopy openings appears feasible even on high productivity mesic sites, but such treatments are likely to have low success rates if openings are small and understory vegetation is not controlled. However, they may be adequate for establishing a minor pine component, especially in northern hardwood stands designated for uneven-aged management. Such low-intensity treatments would also be appropriate in natural areas or parks where pine abundance has declined relative to presettlement conditions and intensive treatments such as shelterwood harvests would not be acceptable. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An innovative aerial survey method called the Landscape Assessment System (LAS) was used to assess mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae)-caused mortality of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) across the species distribution in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE; 894 774 ha). This large-scale implementation of the LAS method consisted of 8673 km of flight lines, along which 4653 geo-tagged, oblique aerial photos were captured at the catchment level (a subset of 12-digit USGS hydrologic units) and geographic information system (GIS) processed. The Mountain Pine Beetle-caused Mortality Rating System, a landscape-scale classification system designed specifically to measure the cumulative effects of recent and older MPB attacks on whitebark pine, was used to classify mortality with a rating from 0 to 6 based on the amount of red (recent attack) and gray (old attack) trees visible. The approach achieved a photo inventory of 79% of the GYE whitebark pine distribution. For the remaining 21%, mortality levels were estimated based on an interpolated surface. Results that combine the photo-inventoried and interpolated mortality indicate that nearly half (46%) of the GYE whitebark pine distribution showed severe mortality (3-4 or 5.3-5.4 rating), 36% showed moderate mortality (2-2.9 rating), 13% showed low mortality (1-1.9 rating), and 5% showed trace levels of mortality (0-0.9). These results reveal that the proliferation of MPB in the subalpine zone of the GYE due to climate warming has led to whitebark pine mortality that is more severe and widespread than indicated from either previous modeling research or USDA Forest Service Aerial Detection surveys. Sixteen of the 22 major mountain ranges of the GYE have experienced widespread moderate-to-severe mortality. The majority of catchments in the other six mountain ranges show low-to-moderate mortality. Refugia from MPB outbreaks, at least for now, also exist and correspond to locations that have colder microclimates. The spatially explicit mortality information produced by this project has helped forest managers develop and implement conservation strategies that include both preservation and restoration efforts. Future research aimed at documenting and quantifying the ecological impacts of widespread decline and collapse of this foundation and keystone species is warranted. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Invasive species can increase the susceptibility of ecosystems to disease by acting as reservoir hosts for pathogens. Invasive hosts are often sparsely recorded and not in equilibrium, so predicting their spatial distributions and overlap with other hosts is problematic. We applied newly developed methods for modelling the distribution of invasive species to the invasive shrub Rhododendron ponticum-a foliar reservoir host for the Phytophthora oomycete plant pathogens, P. ramorum and P. kernoviae, that threaten woodland and heathland habitat in Scotland. We compiled eleven datasets of biological records for R. ponticum (1,691 points, 8,455 polygons) and developed Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models incorporating landscape, soil and climate predictors. Our models produced accurate predictions of current suitable R. ponticum habitat (training AUC = 0. 838; test AUC = 0. 838) that corresponded well with population performance (areal cover). Continuous broad-leaved woodland cover, low elevation (<400 m a. s. l.) and intermediate levels of soil moisture (or Enhanced Vegetation Index) favoured presence of R. ponticum. The high coincidence of suitable habitat with both core native woodlands (54 % of woodlands) and plantations of another sporulation host, Larix kaempferi (64 % of plantations) suggests a high potential for spread of Phytophthora infection to woodland mediated by R. ponticum. Incorporating non-equilibrium modelling methods did not improve habitat suitability predictions of this invasive host, possibly because, as a long-standing invader, R. ponticum has filled more of its available habitat at this national scale than previously suspected. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The 12-site National Fire and Fire Surrogate study (FFS) was a multivariate experiment that evaluated ecological consequences of alternative fuel-reduction treatments in seasonally dry forests of the US. Each site was a replicated experiment with a common design that compared an un-manipulated control, prescribed fire, mechanical and mechanical + fire treatments. Variables within the vegetation, fuelbed, forest floor and soil, bark beetles, tree diseases and wildlife were measured in 10-ha stands, and ecological response was compared among treatments at the site level, and across sites, to better understand the influence of differential site conditions. For most sites, treated stands were predicted to be more resilient to wildfire if it occurred shortly after treatment, but for most ecological variables, short-term response to treatments was subtle and transient. Strong site-specificity was observed in the response of most ecosystem variables, suggesting that practitioners employ adaptive management at the local scale. Because ecosystem components were tightly linked, adaptive management would need to include monitoring of a carefully chosen set of key variables. Mechanical treatments did not serve as surrogates for fire for most variables, suggesting that fire be maintained whenever possible. Restoration to pre-settlement conditions will require repeated treatments over time, with eastern forests requiring more frequent applications. © 2013 IAWF.

AB  - Common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is a keystone tree species throughout temperate Europe whose future existence is threatened by an emerging invasive fungal disease. Ash dieback, which first appeared in Poland in the 1990s, has rapidly spread to most eastern, central and northern European countries. The causal agent of the disease, the ascomycete Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (anamorph Chalara fraxinea), was recently described as a new species. Given that the disease lethally affects ash trees of all age classes, and that ash tree mortality levels are high, F. excelsior and the many organisms dependent on ash trees are under threat. Based on a literature survey, we provide an overview of the present knowledge on ash dieback, identify practical recommendations and point out research needs. The observation of relatively resistant individual ash trees (although at very low frequency) calls for a rapid germplasm collection effort to establish a breeding program for resistance or tolerance to the disease. Ash trees that appear to be tolerant to the pathogen should not be felled, unless they pose an unacceptable risk to people's security. Given that the pathogen does not form propagules on wood, and given the importance of deadwood for biodiversity conservation, dead and dying ash trees should be left in the forest. Landscape pathology and genetic tools can be used to reconstruct the dispersal pathways of H. pseudoalbidus and to identify environmental features associated with variation in disease severity, so as to better predict the further development of the epidemic. Observations on differences in susceptibility of various ash species are needed to locate the geographic origin of the pathogen and to identify Fraxinus species which might be used for resistance breeding or even replacement of F. excelsior. Conservation biologists, landscape managers, restoration ecologists, social scientists and tree geneticists need to engage with forest pathologists and the various stakeholders throughout the distributional range of F. excelsior so as to tackle this pressing conservation challenge. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Has the discontinuation of traditional management practices and cultural severance in the landscape led to the end of tradition? Or is the end of tradition an opportunity for a new beginning? Through an analysis of satoyama woodlands in Japan, this chapter suggests that while older traditions may be coming to an end, new common traditions are being reassembled from the fragmented pieces. Traditional forms of common ownership and management of satoyama woodlands have been largely extinguished. Until recently, these woodlands were less exemplary of a commons, than of the anti-commons: a situation where fragmented ownership leads to resource underuse. The concept of the anti-commons provides an institutional basis for understanding why satoyama woodlands are under-managed. However, it provides little assistance in explaining why new commoning traditions are developing between urban residents and private satoyama woodland owners on the urban fringe. Since the 1990s in particular, thousands of volunteer groups have formed to restore management to abandoned satoyama woodlands, reclaiming these privately owned woodlands as local commons. To understand this reinvention of the commons, we must, integrate analyses of the institutional basis for successful collective action, with accounts of the interconnections between the historical fluidity and shifting symbolic significance of the commons. Such an integrated framework helps to explain why the anti-commons tragedy plaguing satoyama woodlands is being resolved through common solutions. It also suggests that the end of tradition is indeed an opportunity for re-assembling the commons. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in the Southwest United States are experiencing, or have become increasingly susceptible to, large-scale severe wildfire, insect, and disease episodes resulting in altered plant and animal demographics, reduced productivity and biodiversity, and impaired ecosystem processes and functions. We present a management framework based on a synthesis of science on forest ecology and management, reference conditions, and lessons learned during implementations of our restoration framework. Our framework focuses on the restoration of key elements similar to the historical composition and structure of vegetation in these forests: (1) species composition; (2) groups of trees; (3) scattered individual trees; (4) grass-forb-shrub interspaces; (5) snags, logs, and woody debris; and (6) variation in the arrangements of these elements in space and time. Our framework informs management strategies that can improve the resiliency of frequent-fire forests and facilitate the resumption of characteristic ecosystem processes and functions by restoring the composition, structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation. We believe restoration of key compositional and structural elements on a per-site basis will restore resiliency of frequent-fire forests in the Southwest, and thereby position them to better resist, and adapt to, future disturbances and climates.

AB  - Currently, the study of forest ecosystem health, a new and controversial research field within forestry and forest ecology, provides a scientific basis for forest protection. The study of forest ecosystem health also provides a significant practical service by suggesting ways to increase the level of sustainability in forest management although the definition of forest health remains controversial. The concept of health is well understood as applied to humans but the human concept of health may not be appropriate for ecosystems. The difficulties of defining the optimal conditions for ecosystem health have led to a lack of universally accepted indicators used to measure ecosystem health. Several forest ecosystem health assessment systems have already been developed. For example, ecosystem health can be assessed using measures of resilience, vigor and organization and most of today's assessment systems are based on these concepts. In this research, the forest ecosystem health of 60 sample plots in Wangqing Forest was investigated. A new assessment model of forest ecosystem health based on the disturbance, H = ∑B2 W2 - ∑B1 W1, is proposed and used in this study, where H represents a measure of ecosystem health and B1, B2, W1 and W2 represent harmful sources of disturbance, forest ecosystem stability, the weights of B1 and B2, respectively. Based on qualitative analysis of existing data, eight indices which were divided into two categories were selected as assessment indices of forest ecosystem health in Wangqing Forest. Several harmful sources of disturbance were considered including forest diseases, forest pest species, wildfires and human-caused disturbances. Measurements of forest ecosystem stability include measurements of biological diversity, forest community structure and measurements documenting how closely a forest study plot resembles expected natural forest conditions. These types of data have frequently been used to measure ecosystem complexity and health. Additionally, two types of analysis, the Analytic Hierarchy Process and coefficient of variation analysis, were used in combination with weighted evaluation indictors to objectively evaluate the forest health of the study plots. We propose a new forest ecosystem healthy assessment model and classification system. The 60 sample plots of Wangqing Forest were divided into four health risk categories: very healthy, healthy, fairly healthy and unhealthy. By calculating a composite value for forest health, the status of forest ecosystem health of individual Wangqing Forest plots was determined. As the results showed, 6, 13, 23 and 18 (or 10%, 21.67%, 38.33%, and 30% of all plots) plots were categorized as very healthy, healthy, fairly healthy, and unhealthy, respectively; the health indices for these four groups of plots were measured as 0.5 ≥0.2, 0.2 ≥0.1, 0 ≥0.1, -0.5< 0, respectively. Most of the forest plots with conditions resembling natural forest conditions, high levels of biodiversity and a strong ability to adjust to environmental change, such as pure natural forest, natural mixed needleleaf/ broadleaf forest and mixed broadleaf forest, were categorized as healthy or fairly-healthy, while nearly all plantation forests plots which did not have conditions resembling natural forest conditions, but had low levels of biodiversity and a weak ability to adjust to environmental change were classified as unhealthy. This forest health assessment/ indicator system establishes a scientific basis for conducting forest health analysis, provides a context for planning ecosystem restoration, and contributes to the understanding of the physical, biological, and human dimensions of these ecosystems. This research may enrich current theories and methods used in assessing the health of ecological systems.

AB  - The genetic consequences of natural in situ recovery for rare or threatened species are not as well understood as the impact of population bottlenecks, fragmentation and admixture, particularly the mechanisms by which genetic diversity is lost or preserved as populations recover. Here we examine how mating patterns, dispersal and ecologically constrained regeneration influences genetic diversity and kinship in a naturally regenerating population of a threatened temperate forest tree, Juglans cinerea L. (butternut). Butternut regeneration is now rare throughout the native range due to the butternut canker, a lethal fungal disease from Asia, and land use changes. In this study of one of the only known regenerating patches large enough for kinship and parentage analysis, we used 12 microsatellite markers, direct and inferred parentage analyses and Bayesian clustering of 152 trees to show that natural regeneration at this site resulted in loss of allele richness due to a small number of parents, most of which are spatially proximal to the regenerants. Of the 116 potential parents tested, one contributed 20.8 % and the top four contributed 71.1 % of the gametes in 36 regenerants. Parent-parent and parent-offspring distances revealed limited pollen and seed dispersal (<100 m). Regenerants were highly related and spatially clustered in sibling groups. Proximity to the regenerating patch was the most significant factor in parental success. Our results suggest that in situ regeneration of forest trees with limited propagule dispersal and specific site requirements may be insufficient to preserve native genetic diversity in protected areas with few suitable sites. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - While governments normally take action to eradicate or control feral populations of introduced species, management becomes problematic in the rare event of an inadvertent reintroduction of a locally extinct species to its former range. Free-living wild boars became extinct in Britain around 700 years ago, but animals have recently escaped from farms and recolonised parts of England. There has been much debate about the potential ecological and economic impacts of the presence of feral populations of wild boar in England. Predicted negative impacts include disease transmission to domestic pigs, crop damage and problems caused by the species' rooting behaviour. Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of the wild boars in England is the restoration of a formerly native species. However, for the re-established populations to have an intrinsic value as an addition to English biodiversity, it would be preferable if the animals were genetically pure wild boars. We used four genetic marker systems to assess the genetic status of a wild boar population in the Forest of Dean, western England. We found high frequencies of alleles of domestic origin at the mitochondrial control region and a nuclear pseudo-gene. Microsatellite-based analyses also suggested that English wild boars had a mixed wild boar/domestic pig ancestry. Therefore, it is debatable whether the wild boar in the Forest of Dean can be regarded as a restored native species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - For over a century, white pine blister rust (WPBR), caused by the introduced fungal pathogen, Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch., has affected white pine (Subgenus Strobus) individuals, populations, and associated forest communities in North America. We surveyed eight populations of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) across a range of environmental conditions in subalpine forests of the Lake Tahoe Basin, California and Nevada, to determine how WPBR is influencing host fecundity (i.e., female cone production and recruitment), survival, and current population trends. In this region and throughout its range whitebark pine is an important component of subalpine ecosystems. In high-elevation forests of the Lake Tahoe Basin, the primary negative effect of this rust pathogen on whitebark pine is infection and mortality of cone-bearing branches.Mean incidence of WPBR among whitebark pine populations was 35% and ranged from 1% to 65%. Given the high disease incidence, relationships were found between WPBR infection and reproductive output. Percent of individuals infected per population (R 2=0.78), average number of WPBR-infected branches per population (R 2=0.71), and severity of stem girdling (R 2=0.76) were all negatively related with cone production. A positive relationship was found between disease severity (i.e., extent of stem girdling) and available water capacity and a negative relationship was found between disease severity and%sand content. Environmental conditions, including soil properties, may affect pathogen growth and potentially influence the rate at which green infected trees lose the ability to produce female cones. Demographic trends for 7 of 8 whitebark pine populations were stable, with estimates of geometric growth rate (λ)≥1.0. Population stability is a function of adequate population sizes, mixed-size structure, high survivorship, and moderate fecundity. Results show that WPBR is adversely affecting fecundity but having little effect on survivorship. Restoration strategies are designed to facilitate whitebark pine recruitment and deploy genetically diverse seedling material and potentially WPBR-resistant phenotypes. Our study highlights a need for long-term demographic data and monitoring of WPBR-infection to better understand population consequences and host responses in the future. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Prevention efforts to combat pine wilt disease must be instituted to avoid destruction of coastal forests in Hokkaido, northern Japan. We examine an alternative method involving the conversion of Pinus thunbergii forests to native broadleaf species through advancing their growth, but we have little knowledge about the response of advanced growth to overhead canopy release. To demonstrate the demographic and height growth response of advanced growth to the light change in a coastal Pinus thunbergii forest, canopy trees were removed and the sapling populations were monitored for 6 years. Inhibition in height growth caused by light increase was observed in Cerasus sargentii and Kalopanax septemlobus saplings. Especially in Kalopanax septemlobus, a remarkable decline was observed in the saplings growing in the darker positions which experienced light change. Therefore, large light changes should be carefully avoided for this species especially in the darker positions. In contrast, relative height growth rates of Quercus crispula and, especially, Quercus dentata increased with increasing light, and saplings tended to die in the darker positions. No dead trees of Sorbus commixta were observed during the study period. The saplings also showed good height growth even when under closed canopy. This species seems to be adaptive to a dark environment. Since Quercus dentata and Kalopanax septemlobus are the major components of the natural coastal forests in Hokkaido, gradual canopy release is available to foster advanced growth in coastal Pinus thunbergii forest, in accordance with the concept of density control in coastal forests. © 2011 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer.

AB  - Few records concerning pre-blight seed production of forest grown American chestnut (Castanea dentata) exist. As blight resistant American chestnut becomes available to use in restoration efforts, many conservation groups are interested in reintroducing the species as a wildlife food resource. As part of a long-term ecological study involving a disjunct population of American chestnut in Wisconsin, we examined seed production of mature forest grown trees in fall 2005 and 2006. Eleven large diameter (&gt; 23 cm DBH), overstory position, fruiting American chestnuts were selected and measured for height, crown spread, crown volume, and dbh. Because seed predation is intense on this species, we indirectly measured seed production by counting the large opened and spiny cupules (i.e., burs) beneath the tree canopy, along with any cupules remaining on the tree. Castanea dentata typically produces three seeds per cupule, allowing for a reasonably accurate estimate of seed production, and cupules are rarely moved by seed predators. One half of the total projected canopy area was sampled plus an additional meter beyond the canopy edge. This method requires no estimation for losses due to predation or trap damage as found in traditional seed trap experiments. Mean seed production per m 2 of basal area was 69,489 in 2005 and 74,825 in 2006. A significant relationship between total number of seeds produced and DBH was found in 2005 but not in 2006. Using basal area measurements from the stand, we would expect 1.04×10 6 seeds produced per hectare with 2758.5 kg ha -1 of mast production. Based on a sample of seeds we were able to collect from the forest floor, mean seed weight was 2.65 g (± 0.039 SE). Overall, the results indicate that the decline of American chestnut after infection by the chestnut blight likely had a very significant impact on the availability of important wildlife food resources in stands where the species was dominant. © 2012 Torrey Botanical Club.

AB  - Garlic mustard is an invasive, exotic herb that is now widespread in North America. Recent research has shown that garlic mustard exudes biochemical compounds that inhibit the growth of entomopathogenic fungi. We investigated how the removal of garlic mustard would affect the abundance of entomopathogenic fungi in forest soils in eastern New York. Using a standard bioassay, we compared the abundance of entomopathogenic fungi in soil with and without garlic mustard both before and 45 d after garlic mustard had been experimentally removed. In soil from which garlic mustard had been experimentally removed 45 d earlier, the abundance of entomopathogenic fungi was restored to levels found in soil with no history of garlic mustard. These results suggest it is possible to increase the abundance of entomopathogenic fungi in the soil in a short time by eradicating garlic mustard plants from an invaded area. Recolonization by entomopathogenic fungi could be beneficial to humans if it increases the mortality of arthropods that are vectors of infectious disease, such as blacklegged ticks, but harmful if it increases the mortality of arthropods that provide valuable ecosystem services, such as bees and ants. Nomenclature: Garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara & Grande, Beauveria bassiana (Bals.-Criv.) Vuill Management Implications: Garlic mustard is known to have an inhibitory effect on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. However, less is known about the herb's effects on underground entomopathogenic fungi, or more specifically, about how the soil microbiota responds to the removal of the plant. We investigated how long it takes for the soil to recover natural levels of entomopathogenic fungi once garlic mustard is removed. In this study, we sampled soil for entomopathogenic fungi in areas invaded by garlic mustard and areas free of garlic mustard. We then removed garlic mustard plants from forest plots and sampled the soil again 45 d later. The abundance of entomopathogenic fungi in all areas that had garlic mustard removed from them increased during the 1.5-mo period and reached even greater levels compared with areas which had no history of garlic mustard. Soil disturbance alone did not have an effect on the abundance of entomopathogenic fungi. The ability of entomopathogens to recover shortly after garlic mustard removal can benefit humans because the number of disease-carrying arthropod vectors (e.g., blacklegged ticks) may decline as a result. However, it can also be harmful to us because the number of arthropods that provide valuable ecosystem services (e.g., ants, bees) may also diminish. We conclude that garlic mustard removal might be one of the ways to increase the abundance of entomopathogenic fungi in the soil during a short time and, therefore, a way to restore a natural mechanism for arthropod population control. © Weed Science Society of America.

AB  - This study examines the ecological niche of American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh) and the latest blight resistant American chestnut × Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) hybrids. Planted seedlings of chestnut, tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and chestnut oak (Quercus prinus L.) were subjected to two levels of light and two soil types in parallel field and greenhouse studies. The field study took place in the Appalachian ridge and valley province of Virginia. Growth and survival were quantified after three growing seasons. The interaction between light levels and topographic position (soil type) was significant for growth rates in the field and greenhouse. Species were significantly different from each other although hybrid varieties were not significantly different from each other or from pure American chestnut. Tulip poplar showed the greatest growth rates under all treatments in the field. Both tulip poplar and chestnut had the greatest growth rates in large gaps within mesic, mid and lower slope (MML) sites in the field. In contrast to growth, optimal conditions for survival differed among species. Tulip poplar had the greatest survival (71%) within large gaps in MML sites while chestnuts and oaks had the greatest overall survival (64%) in small gaps within xeric, upper slope and ridge (XUR) sites. In the greenhouse, tulip poplar did not outperform chestnut. Discrepancies in field and greenhouse studies were accounted for by uncontrolled factors, such as rodent predation. We conclude that optimal sites for planting American chestnut hybrids are in small gaps located within XUR sites. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Forests dominated by oak, beech, hornbeam, and boreal conifers are characterized by resource pulses. Contemporary eastern U.S. oak forests may exhibit dramatic resource pulses in part because of the loss of American chestnut, which comprised 25-50% of the canopy throughout its range. Chestnut loss may have reduced mast resources for wildlife. A newly developed, blight-resistant hybrid makes reintroduction feasible within several years. We use historical data to model the effects of American chestnut mast on consumer populations, illuminating the potential ecological effects of a successful restoration. We parameterized a stochastic population growth model with mast production data to compare consumer population dynamics both pre- and post-blight. We explored the effect of maximum intrinsic population growth rate, degree of density dependence, and reliance upon mast on consumer response to chestnut loss. We parameterized the models for white-footed mouse, eastern chipmunk, gray squirrel, and white-tailed deer. At a northern site 14 years post-blight, simulated annual mast production decreased 80% and the coefficient of variation (CV) increased 60%. At a southern site 35 years post-blight, annual mast production decreased by 35% and the CV increased by 76%. Smaller, more variable mast crops translated to reduced abundance and increased variability in simulated consumer populations. White-footed mice were the most responsive, exhibiting a 48% decrease in population size and 57% increase in interannual variation post-blight. The reintroduction of blight-resistant chestnut may fundamentally alter predator-prey interactions, gypsy moth outbreaks, and Lyme disease hot spots through its effect on the character of resource pulses that drive consumer dynamics. © 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - Native Americans relied on fire to maintain a cultural landscape that sustained their lifeways for thousands of years. Within the past 100 years, however, policies of fire exclusion have disrupted ecological processes, elevating risk of wildfire, insects, and disease, affecting the health and availability of resources on which the tribes depend. On Indian Reservations, tribal forest plans include prescribed fire to restore and maintain the lands. Public land managers are now considering ways to restore the fire-based ecosystem, but tribal knowledge about the use and effects of fire has largely been left out of the discussion. For 2 days in June 2010, 7 tribal elders joined with 20 native and nonnative scientists, resource managers, and academics to explore ways to integrate Native American stewardship practices, traditional knowledge, and philosophies with western science to address contemporary forest health and wildfire challenges. The workshop, convened on the Flathead Indian Reservation of the Confederated Salish Kootenai Tribes located in western Montana, provided a forum for candid dialogue and knowledge sharing. This article, coauthored by all 27 participants, offers a summary background followed by candid highlights of dialogue along with recommendations for progress based on lessons learned. The central conclusion is that integration and application of traditional knowledge with western science for improved stewardship of natural resources will require enduring commitments to knowledge sharing that extend beyond the usual boundaries of professional training and cultural orientation such that learning can proceed, legacy myths might be corrected, and the forests and the people will benefit. © 2012 by the Society of American Foresters.

AB  - • Soil-borne pathogens are a key component of the belowground community because of the significance of their ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, very little is known about the complexity of their distribution patterns in natural systems. Here, we explored the patterns, causes and ecological consequences of spatial variability in pathogen abundance in Mediterranean forests affected by oak decline. • We used spatially explicit neighborhood models to predict the abundance of soil-borne pathogen species (Phytophthora cinnamomi, Pythium spiculum and Pythium spp.) as a function of local abiotic conditions (soil texture) and the characteristics of the tree and shrub neighborhoods (species composition, size and health status). The implications of pathogen abundance for tree seedling performance were explored by conducting a sowing experiment in the same locations in which pathogen abundance was quantified. • Pathogen abundance in the forest soil was not randomly distributed, but exhibited spatially predictable patterns influenced by both abiotic and, particularly, biotic factors (tree and shrub species). Pathogen abundance reduced seedling emergence and survival, but not in all sites or tree species. • Our findings suggest that heterogeneous spatial patterns of pathogen abundance at fine spatial scale can be important for the dynamics and restoration of declining Mediterranean forests. © 2012 The Authors New Phytologist. © 2012 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Background: Accurately quantifying key interactions between species is important for developing effective recovery strategies for threatened and endangered species. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a candidate species for listing under the Endangered Species Act, depends on Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) for seed dispersal. As whitebark pine succumbs to exotic disease and mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae), cone production declines, and nutcrackers visit stands less frequently, reducing the probability of seed dispersal. Methodology/Principal Findings: We quantified whitebark pine forest structure, health metrics, and the frequency of nutcracker occurrence in national parks within the Northern and Central Rocky Mountains in 2008 and 2009. Forest health characteristics varied between the two regions, with the northern region in overall poorer health. Using these data, we show that a previously published model consistently under-predicts the proportion of survey hours resulting in nutcracker observations at all cone density levels. We present a new statistical model of the relationship between whitebark pine cone production and the probability of Clark's nutcracker occurrence based on combining data from this study and the previous study. Conclusions/Significance: Our model clarified earlier findings and suggested a lower cone production threshold value for predicting likely visitation by nutcrackers: Although nutcrackers do visit whitebark pine stands with few cones, the probability of visitation increases with increased cone production. We use information theoretics to show that beta regression is a more appropriate statistical framework for modeling the relationship between cone density and proportion of survey time resulting in nutcracker observations. We illustrate how resource managers may apply this model in the process of prioritizing areas for whitebark pine restoration.

AB  - Pine wilt disease is a severe threat to the native pine forests in East Asia. Understanding the natural regeneration of the forests disturbed by pine wilt disease is thus critical for the conservation of biodiversity in this realm. We studied the dynamics of composition and structure within different plant functional types (PFTs) in Masson pine forests affected by pine wilt disease (PWD). Based on plant traits, all species were assigned to four PFTs: evergreen woody species (PFT1), deciduous woody species (PFT2), herbs (PFT3), and ferns (PFT4). We analyzed the changes in these PFTs during the initial disturbance period and during post-disturbance regeneration. The species richness, abundance and basal area, as well as life-stage structure of the PFTs changed differently after pine wilt disease. The direction of plant community regeneration depended on the differential response of the PFTs. PFT1, which has a higher tolerance to disturbances, became dominant during the post-disturbance regeneration, and a young evergreen-broad-leaved forest developed quickly after PWD. Results also indicated that the impacts of PWD were dampened by the feedbacks between PFTs and the microclimate, in which PFT4 played an important ecological role. In conclusion, we propose management at the functional type level instead of at the population level as a promising approach in ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation. © 2012 Hu et al.

AB  - American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) was functionally removed as a forest tree by chestnut blight (caused by the fungal pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr). Hybrid-backcross breeding between blight-resistant Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) and American chestnut is used to support species restoration. However, preliminary evidence suggests that backcross material may not have the cold hardiness needed for restoration in the northern portions of the species' range. The cold tolerance of nuts is of concern because reproductive tissues are particularly sensitive to freezing damage. We assessed nut cold tolerance for 16 American chestnut, four Chinese chestnut, and four red oak (Quercus rubra L.) (a native competitor) sources to better assess genetic variation in nut hardiness. We found that Chinese chestnut nuts were less cold tolerant than American chestnut and red oak nuts and that American chestnut sources from the south were less cold tolerant than sources from the north, with significant differences among sources within all regions. We also assessed how sources varied among temperature zones (sources separated by average winter temperature lows at source locations). Sources from the cold temperature zone were more cold tolerant and less variable in hardiness than sources from warm and moderate zones.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prospect of pouch failure needs to be considered when evaluating the management strategy for patients who may be candidates for an ileo anal pouch. An ability to predict the likelihood and timing of failure preoperatively may influence surgical decision making. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to define a preoperative prognostic model for ileoanal pouch failure. DESIGN: A novel random forest methodology was used to evaluate the prognostic significance of 21 preoperative potential risk factors for pouch failure. A forest of 3000 random survival trees was grown to estimate pouch failure for each patient and to identify important risk factors that maximize survival prediction. SETTINGS: This study took place at a tertiary referral department at a major academic medical center. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing an ileoanal pouch at this institution between 1983 and 2008 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was pouch survival. RESULTS: Between 1983 and 2008, 3754 patients underwent ileoanal pouch. Type of resection (total proctocolectomy vs completion proctectomy), type of anastomosis (stapled vs mucosectomy), patient diagnosis (mucosal ulcerative colitis and others vs Crohn's disease) and diagnosis of diabetes had the strongest effect on pouch survival. Predicted survival was worse for completion proctectomy (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.08 -1.93), Crohn's disease (HR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.48 -3.79), handsewn anastomosis (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.23-2.42), and diabetes (HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.25-4.24). Pouch survival was worse for the oldest group of patients. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective nature. CONCLUSION: Random forest techniques applied to a large number of patients undergoing the ileoanal pouch identify factors associated with pouch failure. Attention directed at these factors may improve outcomes for these patients. © The ASCRS 2012.

AB  - The history of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) forests over the past century exemplifies modern environmental change and the particular challenges faced in reconciling the scales of human observation with long-term ecological changes. A number of factors are implicated in driving observed declines in whitebark pine populations including fire suppression, climate change, the exotic pathogen Cronartium ribicola and associated white pine blister rust, and mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, yet the actual effects of these factors vary widely across the range of whitebark pine that encompasses considerable environmental heterogeneity. Furthermore, the specific effects of these agents are difficult to isolate or predict in a forest type where disturbance regimes and succession operate on scales of centuries rather than decades. The resulting situation is highly complex, yet the urgency for restoration in some areas is leading to generalizations elsewhere that do not always account for the diversity of forests considered as whitebark pine communities. Our research reviews the current state of knowledge on the biogeography, disturbance regimes, and mechanisms of decline in whitebark pine communities. We then use an expanded temporal perspective based on dendroecological case studies to critically assess the potential effects of fire suppression in whitebark pine communities and the ecological relationship between whitebark pine and mountain pine beetle. Based on our findings, it appears that fire suppression is not the ubiquitous factor leading to whitebark pine declines, as often implicated in the published literature, and that whitebark pine may be well adapted to recover following mountain pine beetle outbreaks in areas that have not been impacted too severely from white pine blister rust. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Generally, the word 'structure', in forest ecosystem refers to the spatial arrangement of tree's characteristics (i.e. age, dimension, species, sexuality etc.). Nowadays, studying forest stands spatial structures is extensively used for determining habitat and species diversity. For sustainable forest management, describing stand structure before applying silvicultural and utilization practices, as well as investigation of induced changes as a result of management activities are essential. Commonly, according to Kint et al. (2000), forest spatial structure can be considered at three different levels: 1). Positioning or contagion; indicates the spatial distribution of trees under special pattern such as: regular, random, cluster or mixed features of the mentioned patterns; 2). Mixture; investigates spatial arrangement of different tree species. 3). Dimension; investigates the relative dimensions among neighboring trees. Elm (Ulmus glabra Hudson) is one of the most valuable and native species distributed all over the Caspian forests. Nowadays, elm is considered as endangered species due to intensive human activities and outbreak of Dutch elm disease over the last few decades. With regard to the importance of elm and to conserve and retrieve this species, comprehensive and integrated studies are required to be performed regarding spatial structure of the trees and investigation of their relations with neighboring species. Materials and Methods: This study was performed in Gorazbon district, Kheirud Forest, north of Iran, with an area about 1001 ha including 27 compartments. The data used in this study was collected from 243 circle-shaped sample plots with an area of 1000 m 2. In each sample plot, species, DBH, azimuth and distance from the plot center were measured. In addition to the description of a family of indices based on the nearest neighbor, this study deals with quantifying the spatial structure of elm. The following indices were utilized in this study: 1) Uniform Angle Index (W i) The UAI describes contagion degree of trees spatial structures related to the reference tree (i) and four neighborhood trees (j). UAI is based on the comparison angle between neighborhood trees (α j) and standard angle (α 0)- This index is obtained from Eq. (1): mathematical equation represented. It is noteworthy that in Eq.(1) W i is referred to the quantitative value of Uniform Angle Index (dimensionless). 2) Species Mingling Index (DM i) Forest researchers believe that biodiversity is an important aspect of forest sustainable management; thus, a number of indices have been developed to describe biodiversity. In present study the DM i, which is frequently proposed, was utilized to evaluate the species diversity. This index is obtained from Eq. (2): mathematical equation represented. 3) DBH Dominance Index (TD i) The TD 1, is the third aspect of forest spatial structure that describes the relative dimension of a tree species to the immediate neighbor. This index is obtained from Eq. (3):mathematical equation represented . In this research, in addition to quantifying elm spatial structure, deviation between observed and simulated forest was calculated using absolute discrepancy (AD) algorithm. This algorithm is obtained from Eq. (4):mathematical equation represented. Discussion of Results: The mean value of UAI for elm in Gorazbon district was calculated to be 0.54. This value shows a random distribution with a small relative tendency to cluster. Also, according to the absolute discrepancy algorithm, AD was calculatedto be 0.212, for this species. Fig. 1 shows the relative frequency of the contagion distribution of elm for observed and simulated forest stands. The mean value of mingling index for elm was obtained to be 0.9. This value shows that elms were facing a high degree of competition with other species. According to the absolute discrepancy algorithm, the deviation of mingling distributions observed in simulated forest, AD, was calculated to be 0.322. Fig. 2 shows the relative frequency of the mingling distribution of elm for observed and simulated forest stands. The values of DBH dimension index for observed and simulated forests are shown in Fig. 3. Mean value and absolute discrepancy algorithm (AD) for this index were 0.32 and 0.131, respectively. In other words, this index indicated that elm is dominant in comparison with other neighbors. Conclusion - Monitoring management activities and evolution of forest ecosystems with above-mentioned indices are of great importance in conservation of biodiversity, controlling extinction process and decreasing environmental destructive impacts. In general, this monitoring is useful for restoration and conservation of elm in Caspian forest.

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify the influence of interannual and interdecadal climate variation and changes in land use on fire regimes in fire prone mixed conifer forests in the central Sierra Nevada in Yosemite National Park, California. We quantified fire frequency, fire return interval, fire extent, and season of fire for a 400year period using fire-scar dendrochronology. The influence of regional climate variability and land use on fire occurrence and extent was assessed by relating the fire record to regional climate reconstructions and to documentary records of settlement and land use. The timing and extent for fires was related to interannual and interdecadal variation in drought and temperature linked to variation in the Pacific North America Pattern (PNA), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (NINO) had little effect on fire. The occurrence of large fires was also influenced by interactions among climate patterns and they occurred more often than expected in PNA + NIñO3-years. At interdecadal time scales area burned was positively correlated with temperature and the PNA. Fire occurrence and extent declined with mid-19th century Euro-American settlement and land use change and fire was nearly eliminated after 1900 when a fire exclusion policy was implemented. A two-fold increase in rate of burning in the late 18th and early 19th century corresponds with spread of non-native disease to Native American populations during the Spanish Colonial Period but the PNA was also mainly positive during this period. Fire regimes were sensitive to shifting modes of climate and land use which can lead to variable pathways of forest development and hence forest structure. Forest structure at the time of Euro-American settlement reflects this sensitivity and managers should consider presettlement conditions as only a guide for restoration planning in forests highly altered by fire exclusion under a changing climate. Moreover, considering winter PNA could provide managers with an early indication of conditions during the fire season that are conducive to widespread fire. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Austrianpine (Pinus nigra Arnold) was commonly planted during the last century in Croatia. Afforestation took place on various sites to prevent land from erosion and, or to restore forest vegetation, mainly in karst areas. Since 1992 the study on health status of Austrian pine plantations in Croatia revealed significant dieback symptoms in some areas as the consequence ofSphaeropsis sapinea occurrence. Research carried out in November 2001 found the fungus presence with different impact to P. nigra in Istria, healthy sites and also ones with various disease symptoms were observed (Figure 1, Table 1). In plantations which revealed good health status S. sapinea was found only on cones, but in plantations with dieback symptoms its presence was found in needles, shoots and branches, causing in some cases dieback of trees. According to dieback symptoms observed, research localities were categorised in four health categories as shown in Figure 1. It was revealed that along the drought (Figures 19 and 20, an example for period 1961-1990 vs. 1999), the site conditions also played an important role in pines' predisposition to fungus attack during last years. This conclusion was supported by analyses of nutrition status in pines and site conditions (soil sub-types, soil types and depth, site rockiness, exposition and inclination, Table 1). Analyses of nutrition status obtained clear difference among sites comparing the nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) concentrations in pine needles (Figures 6-11). In sites with lower N/K ratio the disease symptoms were not observed, but in sites with increased N/K ratio the dieback symptoms were revealed, following nitrogen and potassium relation in general (Figures 12 and 13). According to Brown (1999) fertilization only by nitrogen can increase the susceptibility of broadleaved trees to pathogenic organisms due to the influence of nitrogen on growth of aboveground plant biomass, and imbalance of above- and belowground plant parts biomass can lead to the increased suceptibility of trees to water stress. Higher nitrogen concentartions as pines' predisposition to S. sapinea were confirmed by De Kam et al. (1991), Van Dijk et al. (1992) and Stanosz et al. (2004). Opposite to nitrogen, potassium play important role in plant resistance to drought and pathogenic organisms (Bergmann 1992, Marschner 1995). Inoculation experiment in Austrian pine seedlings confirmed the S. sapinea pathogenicity and also the same capability of isolates obtained from healthy nedles (VIPAVA, IMI368260) and ones with symptoms (DP 04-1 and DP 06-3, described in Diminić et al. 2004) to cause bark necrosis. Previous fertilization with ammonium sulphate caused increased seedlings growth according to treatments: 0, 20, 40 and 80 g/m2, and also increased length of bark necrosis in inoculated pines (Tables 2 and 3, Figures 14-18), which supported the nitrogen role in disease development. According to up-to-day worldwide knowledge and results of our research, it can be concluded that S. sapinea can live (latentphase) in healthy looking pines in Istria. And, in drought periods it can turn to serious pathogen, causing dieback in predisposed trees. It this circumstances, site play an important role in pines 'resistance to disease, indirectly influencing appearance (or not) of various dieback symptoms.

AB  - Comparative inventories in 1969 and 1970 and in 2008 of vegetation from 30 forest stands downstream of Garrison Dam on the Missouri River in central North Dakota showed (a) a sharp decline in Cottonwood regeneration; (b) a strong compositional shift toward dominance by green ash; and (c) large increases in invasive understory species, such as smooth brome, reed canary grass, and Canada thistle. These changes, and others discovered during remeasurement, have been caused by a complex of factors, some related to damming (altered hydrologic and sediment regimes, delta formation, and associated wetdry cycles) and some not (diseases and expansion of invasive plants). Dominance of green ash, however, may be short lived, given the likelihood that the emerald ash borer will arrive in the Dakotas in 510 years, with potentially devastating effects. The prospects for recovery of this valuable ecosystem, rich in ecosystem goods and services and in American history, are daunting. © 2012 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

AB  - Healthy forests are closely related to global ecological stability and sustainable development of human society. It is important to study forest ecosystem health including developing theories related to forest health and exploring various assessment methods. Reasonable methods lead to accurate assessments of forest ecosystem health. The definition of forest health is controversial. The concept of health is well understood as applied to humans but the human concept of health may not be appropriate for ecosystems. The difficulties of defining the optimal conditions for ecosystem health have led to a lack of universally accepted indicators to measure ecosystem health. In this paper, a healthy forest ecosystem is defined as a system having good mechanisms for self-regulation, such as beneficial mechanisms that allow an ecosystem to react to external harmful disturbances. Positive ecosystem responses to negative changes keep forest ecosystems intact, stable and sustainable. With this concept of forest ecosystem health in mind, we can discuss assessment methods which can be used to monitor forest ecosystem health. Several forest ecosystem health assessment systems already exist. For example, ecosystem health can be assessed using measures of resilience, vigor and organization. Today, most assessment systems are based on this concept. Based on the concept of forest ecosystem health presented above, a new approach is proposed, which considers four external harmful disturbances: forest fire, forest pest species, air pollution and human-caused disturbances. This method is designed to build assessment indicator systems which can be used to monitor and evaluate forest ecosystem health. It also considers beneficial disturbances in this assessment indicator system. This method includes an analysis of forest fire disturbance, which causes severe damage to forest ecosystems, followed by eight other indicators of forest health including average precipitation, average temperature, proportion of flammable species, crown density, altitude, slope gradient, slope direction and distance between the forest and the nearest road. Disturbance caused by forest pests can also be measured. These include disturbances caused by forest animals, such as rat and rabbit damage, as well as indicators like forest diseases and forest pests, the degree of damage and rate of infection in host trees. Air pollution disturbance can be measure by studying leaf damage as well as soil and contamination analysis. The study of harmful human-caused disturbances includes measurement of forest management techniques such as timber harvest and management of undergrowth vegetation. Measurements of forest ecosystem stability include measurements of biological diversity, forest community structure and measurements documenting how closely a forest is to natural conditions, with natural conditions defined as being free of human-caused disturbances. These types of measurements have been used frequently to measure ecosystem complexity and health. Next, the content and significance of key indicators were also well-analyzed. This forest ecosystem health assessment indicator system abandons traditional assessment ideas and combines the most important factors which have been determined to be closely related to forest ecosystem health in recent years. This assessment indicator system focuses at the ecosystem level and has mostly been applied to forests both in South and North China. Information is presented for use by forest and district resource managers as well as academic experts. This assessment indicator system establishes a scientific basis for conducting forest health projects, provides a context for planning ecosystem restoration, and contributes to the understanding of the physical, biological, and human dimensions of these ecosystems. This research may enrich the theories and methods used in assessing the health of ecological systems.

AB  - Late-successional and old-growth (LSOG) monitoring characterizes the status and trends of older forests to answer such questions as: How much older forest is there? Where is it? How much has changed and from what causes? Is the Northwest Forest Plan (the Plan) maintaining or restoring older forest ecosystems to desired conditions on federal lands in the Plan area? This assessment is the second in a continuous monitoring cycle. We initially reported on LSOG status and trends from 1994 to 2003 in the "10-year report." This document, the mid-cycle "15-year report," updates the assessment to 2006 in Washington and Oregon and to 2007 in California. The next major assessment will be the 20-year report. We used maps of forest vegetation and change and regional inventory plot data to assess the distribution and trends of LSOG on federal and other lands in the Plan area over the monitoring periods 1994 to 2007 in California and 1996 to 2006 in Washington and Oregon. We used statistical mapping techniques to develop maps of forest composition and structure at the two monitoring cycle endpoints ("bookend" maps), and yearly maps of forest disturbance. From the two bookend maps we assessed changes in the amount and distribution of LSOG (defined as average diameter of overstory conifers >20 in and conifer canopy cover >10 percent) over time. We used the disturbance maps to characterize the agents of change (harvest, wildfire, and insects/disease) associated with areas mapped as LSOG loss from the bookend maps. To corroborate the mapped information, we estimated LSOG area from two successive forest inventories from which such data were available (Forest Service and Oregon Bureau of Land Management lands), and compiled the first Plan-wide estimates of LSOG on all ownerships from a regionally consistent inventory design. The bookend maps suggested a slight net loss (-1.9 percent) of LSOG from federal lands in the Plan area, from 33.2 percent of federal forest to 32.6 percent (from 7.3 to 7.1 million ac). Trends varied by province, but in all cases, the net changes were small relative to the sources of error and uncertainty in the estimates, which limit our ability to estimate the precise amount of LSOG change. Nevertheless, strong evidence suggests that >200,000 ac of LSOG were lost to stand-replacing disturbance (mostly wildfire) on federal lands. Almost 90 percent of the loss of federal LSOG was from reserves. The losses apparently were roughly balanced by recruitment, although recruitment is much more difficult to estimate than disturbance with available data and technology. Recruitment was most likely through incremental stand growth over the 20-in threshold, or from understory disturbances that eliminated smaller diameter trees and increased average stand diameter. Increases in the area of forests of much larger and older trees are unlikely to occur over the 10- to 14-year monitoring period. Use of a more restrictive definition of LSOG (larger average tree size or denser canopy) likely would increase the estimate of LSOG loss and decrease the estimate of LSOG gain. The small net decrease in LSOG was corroborated by successive forest inventories, but the plot-based estimates of LSOG change were not statistically significant. The results support the assumption made in the Plan that the primary responsibility for maintaining or restoring LSOG and related habitats in the Pacific Northwest would fall to public lands. Federal lands contained less than half of the total forest land, but the federal share of total LSOG increased from 65 to 67 percent over the monitoring period. Harvesting removed about 13 percent (approximately 491,000 ac) of LSOG on nonfederal lands. Loss of LSOG on federal lands resulting from harvest was less than 0.5 percent (approximately 32,100 ac). Wildfire was the most significant change agent for LSOG on federal lands over the Plan area, and will continue to be a key consideration for policies affecting older forests, associated species, and watershed conditions.

AB  - Invasive alien species constitute a major threat to biodiversity and cases of extinction caused by invasive alien animals are abundant. However, while invasive alien plants also harm native biota there exists a lack of cases demonstrating their ability to cause extinction of native plant species. Different alien species (vertebrates, invertebrates, pathogens etc.) commonly deliver different simultaneous impacts like predation, disease or competition. In such situations, assessing the contribution of plant invasion in causing decline of a given plant population in its natural habitat can be difficult, yet is desirable to avoid or minimize wastage of managers' resources. Using native angiosperms in lowland wet forests of Mauritius, we first compared native seedling diversity in forest areas that have been weeded of invasive alien plants about a decade previously, with adjacent similar but non-weeded areas. Then, using the weeded area, we compared results of native plant surveys carried out around the time that invasive alien plants were controlled, with the same community about a decade latter. Species richness and abundance of seedlings were higher in the weeded areas compared to the adjacent non weeded forest. We also found that several species that were presumed extinct or critically threatened with extinction had recovered dramatically as a consequence of the sole removal of invasive alien plants. This shows that the threat posed by invasive alien plants can be overwhelmingly important in driving native plant population declines in tropical forests and that imminent plant extinctions can be averted by timely control of alien plants. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Ecological data from land surveys from 1811foRthe 100,000-acre Connecticut Tract in western New York were transcribed and then analyzed using ArcGIS and IDRISI GIS software. The surveys contained both witness tree data and line descriptions, which were analyzed foRspecies composition and community type. Results illustrate that many changes have occurred in species composition. Possible causes of these changes to the mature forests may include introduced pests and diseases oRanthropogenic land-use change. Comparisons to the National Wetlands Inventory Database reveal that while some of the wetlands that were present in 1811still exist today, particularly in the Byron-Bergen Swamp and in the wetlands along the Lake Ontario shoreline, otheRoriginal wetlands have been lost while new wetlands have replaced some upland forests. This study helps elucidate past causes of temporal and spatial variability, and it provides a reference point foRland managers who need to understand the effects of land-use history foRongoing restoration efforts. © 2011 IGI Global.

AB  - Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can cause weakening and destruction of various joints of the foot and may result in pain and deformity. This clinical presentation can cause eventual loss of function, shoe-wear difficulties, and altered gait patterns. Purpose: The goal of this prospective study was to quantify changes in temporal-spatial parameters and multisegmental foot and ankle kinematics in a group of patients with RA of the forefoot following surgery. Methods: Three-dimensional (3-D) motion analysis was conducted preoperatively and postoperatively using a 15-camera Vicon Motion Analysis System (Vicon Motion Systems, Inc.; Lake Forest, CA) on 14 feet in 13 patients with forefoot RA. The Milwaukee foot model was used to characterize segmental kinematics and temporal-spatial parameters. Preoperative and postoperative data were compared using paired nonparametric methods; comparisons with normative data were performed using unpaired nonparametric methods. Results: Preoperatively, the hallux was in a valgus position, the forefoot was abducted and in valgus, and range of motion was limited in various phases in all segments. Walking speed and stride length were decreased and stance prolonged when compared with normal controls. Postoperatively, the hallux alignment was restored to normal but a limited range of motion remained. Kinematics also demonstrated forefoot valgus and tibial internal rotation compared with the control population. Comparisons to healthy ambulators also showed decreased stride lengths and prolonged stance phase durations. Conclusion: Surgery effectively restored alignment and weight-bearing capacity of the rheumatoid feet. Temporal-spatial parameters and kinematics, however, were not restored to control values, but rather were consistent with first metatarsophalangeal joint fusion effects. The altered mechanics after surgery demonstrate the importance of quantitative assessment in understanding the geometric and kinematic effects of surgical realignment with implications for postoperative rehabilitation and gait training. © 2011.

AB  - This chapter demonstrates solutions to damages done to island ecosystems. It cites David Cameron Duffy's 1994 study where he observed that feral animals, diseases, and forest destruction had greatly modified island ecosystems that most were unrecognizable. It highlights how most island management projects focus only on the restoration of single or multiple species, rather than whole communities or ecosystems. It covers examples that span the entire range of ecosystem damage, from partially to wholly modified, and illustrate successes of the entire range of restoration levels ranging from single species to entire ecosystems. It also looks into the development of ecosystem recovery and restoration efforts by describing past accounts such as in the Nonsuch Island in the Caribbean by David Wingate. © 2011 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

AB  - American Forests has approved a new strategic plan which establishes it even more firmly as a conservation organization focused on forests as vital ecosystems that provide important benefits for the health of the planet and its inhabitants. The plan is to increase the focus on environmental science and forest ecology. The plan will also focus on specific ecosystems that are profoundly threatened right now. In 2012, American Forests will launch a major campaign to address the devastation in the forests of the Western Mountains, a result of the mountain pine beetle and a disease called blister rust. Their work will include restoring damaged areas, as well as working with partners to bring attention to the issue and to support research to strengthen keystone species like white bark pine. They will also expand their efforts in urban forests, working with the US Forest Service and partners across the country to spotlight cities and towns.

AB  - Historical logging, fire suppression, and an invasive pathogen, Cronartium ribicola, the cause of white pine blister rust (WPBR), are assumed to have dramatically affected sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) populations in the Lake Tahoe Basin. We examined population- and genetic-level consequences of these disturbances within 10 sugar pine populations by assessing current population structure and trends for 1129 individuals, genetic diversity for 250 individuals, and frequency of WPBR-resistance for 102 families. Logging had occurred in 9 of 10 sites and fire suppression was evident in all stands. High density of white fir (Abies concolor) is often an indicator of fire suppression and we found a negative relationship between sugar pine survivorship and white fir basal area (r2=0.31). C. ribicola was present in 90% of stands (incidence range: 0-48%) and we found a significant relationship between mean host survivorship and disease incidence (r2=0.46). We estimated population growth rates (λ) from size-based transition matrices. For six of 10 sugar pine populations λ was 1.0, indicating that these populations appear to be stable; for four populations, λ was &lt;1.0, indicating populations that may be in decline. A population specific drift parameter, ci, which is a measure of genetic differentiation in allele frequencies relative to an ancestral population, ranged from 0.009 to 0.048. Higher values of ci indicate greater genetic drift, possibly due to a bottleneck caused by historical logging, other agents of mortality or much older events affecting population sizes. Effects of drift are known to be greater in small populations and we found a negative relationship between sugar pine density and ci (r2=0.36). Allele frequency of the Cr1 gene, responsible for WPBR-resistance in sugar pine, averaged 0.068 for all populations sampled; no WPBR infection was found in one population in which the Cr1 frequency was 0.112. Historical disturbances and their interactions have likely influenced the population biology of sugar pine in the Tahoe Basin; for some populations this has meant reduced population size, higher genetic drift, and poor survival of small- and intermediate-sized individuals. Possible management strategies include restoring population numbers, deploying WPBR-resistance, treating stands to promote natural sugar pine regeneration, and enhancing genetic diversity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) returning from the ocean to spawn in urban basins of the Puget Sound region have been prematurely dying at high rates (up to 90% of the total runs) for more than a decade. The current weight of evidence indicates that coho deaths are caused by toxic chemical contaminants in land-based runoff to urban streams during the fall spawning season. Non-point source pollution in urban landscapes typically originates from discrete urban and residential land use activities. In the present study we conducted a series of spatial analyses to identify correlations between land use and land cover (roadways, impervious surfaces, forests, etc.) and the magnitude of coho mortality in six streams with different drainage basin characteristics. We found that spawner mortality was most closely and positively correlated with the relative proportion of local roads, impervious surfaces, and commercial property within a basin. These and other correlated variables were used to identify unmonitored basins in the greater Seattle metropolitan area where recurrent coho spawner die-offs may be likely. This predictive map indicates a substantial geographic area of vulnerability for the Puget Sound coho population segment, a species of concern under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Our spatial risk representation has numerous applications for urban growth management, coho conservation, and basin restoration (e.g., avoiding the unintentional creation of ecological traps). Moreover, the approach and tools are transferable to areas supporting coho throughout western North America.

AB  - American chestnut [Castanea dentata (Marshall) Borkhausen], a canopy dominant species across wide swaths of eastern North America, was reduced to an understory shrub after introduction of the blight fungus [Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr] in the early 1900s. Restoration of American chestnut by using biotechnology is promising, but the imprecise nature of transgenesis may inadvertently alter tree phenotype, thus potentially impacting ecologically dependent organisms. We quantified effects of genetic engineering and fungal inoculation of trees on insect herbivores by using transgenic American chestnuts expressing an oxalate oxidase gene and wild-type American and Chinese (C. mollissima Blume) chestnuts. Of three generalist folivores bioassayed, only gypsy moth [Lymantria dispar (L.)] was affected by genetic modification, exhibiting faster growth on transgenic than on wild-type chestnuts, whereas growth of polyphemus moth [Antheraea polyphemus (Cramer) ] differed between wild-type species, and fall webworm [Hyphantria cunea (Drury) ] performed equally on all trees. Inoculation of chestnuts with blight fungus had no effect on the growth of two herbivores assayed (polyphemus moth and fall webworm). Enhanced fitness of gypsy moth on genetically modified trees may hinder restoration efforts if this invasive herbivore's growth is improved because of transgene expression. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - The O'ahu 'Elepaio (Chasiempis ibidis) is an endangered forest bird endemic to O'ahu and has declined steadily during the past century. Current information on distribution and abundance is needed to help assess the species status and identify areas where recovery efforts can be focused. We used spot-mapping methods to census O'ahu 'Elepaio in all suitable forest habitat in the Wai'anae Mountains from 2006 to 2010 and compared results with previous surveys from the 1990s. We detected a total of 300 O'ahu 'Elepaio, including 108 breeding pairs and 84 single males. The sex ratio was strongly male biased due to nest predation on females. Their distribution was extremely fragmented, and the only concentrations were in 'Ekahanui (38 pairs), Schofield Barracks West Range (40 pairs), and PÄ lehua (15 pairs). We failed to detect 'Elepaio in many areas where they were observed in the 1990s. 'Elepaio have become more sparse in other areas, indicating that they are continuing to decline. Nest predation by alien black rats (Rattus rattus) and mosquito-borne diseases are the greatest threats. Rat control programs have helped reduce nest predation and stop declines in several areas, but only a fraction of remaining 'Elepaio benefit from active management and further declines can be expected unless rats are controlled on a larger scale. Alternative methods of rat control should be explored, and restoration of native trees that are less attractive to rats might provide safer nest sites and reduce the need for rat control. © 2011 by University of Hawai'i Press All rights reserved.

AB  - Phosphite is used to protect plants from the soilborne plant pathogen, Phytophthora cinnamomi. While several studies have reported a stimulation of defence mechanisms in response to the infection of plants treated with phosphite, the effect of phosphite on abiotic wound repair is unknown. The aim of this histological study was to detail the effects of phosphite on previously undescribed wound repair in Eucalyptus marginata, an important forest tree of south-western Australia, which responds to phosphite treatment. Clonal lines of young plants of E. marginata without a periderm, considered resistant and susceptible to P. cinnamomi, were sprayed with phosphite and the green stems were wounded with liquid nitrogen, where a small area of the vascular cambium was damaged. Transverse hand sections showed phosphite had no effect and there was no genotypic difference on wound responses in E. marginata. Wound periderm and a ligno-suberised boundary zone formed within 7 days. The generation of new phellogen derivatives occurred and by 14 days the vascular cambium was almost fully restored with wound wood formed by 21 days. In the absence of a pathogen, phosphite did not interfere with the quality and speed of wound repair in the E. marginata clones suggesting that wound repair will not be affected when phosphite is used as a prophylactic treatment. © 2011 CSIRO.

AB  - Habitat loss and disease are main drivers of global amphibian declines, yet the interaction between them remains largely unexplored. Here we show that paradoxically, habitat loss is negatively associated with occurrence, prevalence, and infection intensity of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in amphibian populations in the tropics. At a large spatial scale, increased habitat loss predicted lower disease risk in amphibian populations across Costa Rica and eastern Australia, even after jointly considering the effect of potential biotic and abiotic correlates. Lower host-species richness and suboptimal microclimates for Bd in disturbed habitats are potential mechanisms underlying this pattern. Furthermore, we found that anthropogenic deforestation practices biased to lowlands and natural vegetation remaining in inaccessible highlands explain increased Bd occurrence at higher elevations. At a smaller spatial scale, holding constant elevation, latitude, and macroclimate, we also found a negative relationship between habitat loss, and both Bd prevalence and infection intensity in frog populations in two landscapes of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our results indicate that amphibians will be disproportionately affected by emerging diseases in pristine environments, and that, paradoxically, disturbed habitats may act as shelters from disease, but only for the very few species that can tolerate deforestation. Thus, tropical amphibian faunas are threatened both by destruction of natural habitats as well as increased disease in pristine forests. To curb further extinctions and develop effective mitigation and restoration programs we must look to interactions between habitat loss and disease, the two main factors at the root of global amphibian declines.

AB  - Anita Studer from Switzerland and Sebastian Chuwa, two Laureates of the Rolex Awards, from Tanzania have together planted over seven million trees to fulfill their dreams of restoring vast, ancient forests and benefiting the communities that depend on them. Sebastian Chuwa shares Studer's passion. His campaign for conservation, reforestation and environmental awareness in Tanzania, near Mt Kilimanjaro, where the forest was disappearing, has started a movement for sustainability and self-empowerment in his community, especially in younger generations. According to Chuwa, the work is time- and labor-intensive as the trees are produced from grafts. Local coffee farms, devastated for years by coffee berry disease, are being revitalized by these new strains, reviving an important industry in the area. Both Laureates have now agreed to cooperate in order to boost tree-planting around the world. Introduced in November, 2010 at an awards ceremony in Lausanne, Switzerland, honoring the Rolex Awards' first Young Laureates, Studer and Chuwa plan to collaborate in the future.

AB  - Koa (Acacia koa) forests are found across broad environmental gradients in the Hawai'ian Islands. Previous studies have identified koa forest health problems and dieback at the plot level, but landscape level patterns remain unstudied. The availability of high-resolution satellite images from the new GeoEye1 satellite offers the opportunity to conduct landscape-level assessments of forest health. The goal of this study was to develop integrated remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) methodologies to characterize the health of koa forests and model the spatial distribution and variability of koa forest dieback patterns across an elevation range of 600-1,000 m asl in the island of Kaua'i, which correspond to gradients of temperature and rainfall ranging from 17-20 °C mean annual temperature and 750-1,500 mm mean annual precipitation. GeoEye1 satellite imagery of koa stands was analyzed using supervised classification techniques based on the analysis of 0.5-m pixel multispectral bands. There was clear differentiation of native koa forest from areas dominated by introduced tree species and differentiation of healthy koa stands from those exhibiting dieback symptoms. The area ratio of healthy koa to koa dieback corresponded linearly to changes in temperature across the environmental gradient, with koa dieback at higher relative abundance in warmer areas. A landscape-scale map of healthy koa forest and dieback distribution demonstrated both the general trend with elevation and the small-scale heterogeneity that exists within particular elevations. The application of these classification techniques with fine spatial resolution imagery can improve the accuracy of koa forest inventory and mapping across the islands of Hawai'i. Such findings should also improve ecological restoration, conservation and silviculture of this important native tree species. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - With a total area of 8900 km2, Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles. It is divided in three physiographic regions or areas of relief: the mountainous interior, the karst region, and the coastal plains and valleys. The island comprises six ecological life zones: subtropical dry forest, subtropical moist forest, subtropical wet forest, subtropical rain forest, lower montane wet forest and lower montane rain forest. The herpetofauna of Puerto Rico consists of 25 species of amphibians (19 native, six introduced) and 56 species of reptiles (52 native, four introduced). The goal of this paper is to describe some of the present studies directed towards the conservation of Puerto Rican herpetofauna. Eleutherodactylus karlschmidti, E. jasperi and E. eneidae have not been seen or heard since 1976, 1981 and 1990, respectively, and are probably extinct. Since 2000, the potential causes of amphibian declines in Puerto Rico have been studied, and a synergistic interaction between climate change (increased dry periods) and disease (chytridiomycosis) have been proposed as an explanation for the patterns observed. Recovery efforts for Peltophryne lemur include a captivebreeding program, reintroductions island-wide educational outreach, protection and restoration of existing habitat, and the creation of new breeding ponds. Among reptiles, the first conservation efforts to protect Epicrates inornatus were limited to trying to halt collection and hunting. However, current strategies to preserve the boa include gathering basic biological information, habitat conservation, and educational outreach. Recent efforts for the conservation of Trachemys s. stejnegeri combine three research approaches to clarify the status of local populations: a mark-recapture-release study, field monitoring of reproductive activity (i.e., nocturnal patrolling to identify nesting activity), and field assessment of the potential impact of introduced species, particularly identification of predatory species and exotic turtles. Recovery initiatives for Cyclura stejnegeri include management of invasive mammals, a headstart program for hatchling iguanas, and the assessment of the etiology of a condition causing blindness in adult iguanas. A reforestation project aimed at recovering a local herpetofaunal assemblage after disturbances in a limestone valley in northern Puerto Rico is discussed. As population sizes of common colonizers such as Eleutherodactylus and Anolis increased, larger forest-interior and predatory species like Epicrates inornatus, Alsophis portoricensis and Anolis cuvieri followed. Finally, the Mona Island marine turtle monitoring program is discussed and compared to other similar programs in Puerto Rico. As these and other similar conservation efforts provide scientifically based management recommendations, we hope to succeed in conserving the diverse herpetofauna that characterizes Puerto Rico.

AB  - As silvicultural objectives have changed over the last several decades, managers are increasingly designing cutting regimes that mimic natural disturbance with the hopes that such systems will restore forests to a more natural condition while optimizing harvest yield. Treefall gaps, canopy openings caused by the death of one or more trees, are the dominant form of disturbance in many forest systems worldwide. These gaps play an important role in forest ecology by helping to maintain bio- and pedo-diversity, influencing nutrient cycling, and preserving the uneven-age nature of late-successional forests. In gap literature, there are inconsistencies with regard to gap terminology, methods for identifying and studying gaps, and modeling gap disturbances. From the papers reviewed, the size of treefall gaps ranges widely from 10 to &gt;5000m2; we suggest that the maximum gap size should be set at 1000m2. Larger openings tend to have microclimates and return intervals significantly different than smaller treefall gaps. Two main definitions of treefall gaps exist: canopy gap: a 'hole' in the forest through all levels down to an average height of 2m above ground and extended gap: canopy gap plus the area that extends to the bases of surrounding canopy trees. Although researchers have assumed a variety of gap shapes to simplify measuring gap size, gaps are often irregularly shaped and so we recommend that gap areas and shapes be determined from detailed field measurements. Gap age may be determined from tree ring analysis of released trees in or near the gap edge, the spacing of whorls on released saplings, or from decomposition of gap-making trees. Windthrow is the main cause of canopy gaps in a variety of ecosystems; other causes include insects, diseases, acidic deposition, drought, and climate change. Treefall-gap models have been developed to predict the following processes during gap making or infilling: (i) gap abundance, (ii) forest structure, (iii) spatial and temporal variations in light levels, (iv) canopy dynamics, and (v) soil nutrient and water regimes. We recommend a protocol for gap studies and identify future research topics. © 2011.

AB  - Disturbance histories drive spatiotemporal patterns of species distributions, and multiple disturbances can have complex effects on these patterns of distribution. The introduction of the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica (Murril.) Barr.) to the eastern United States in the early 1900s coincided with an increase in logging, thus presenting an ideal situation for studying the effect of two disturbance events, logging and disease. The purpose of this study was to compare chestnut (Castanea dentata) abundance and the prevalence of chestnut blight among (1) sites that were and were not logged for chestnuts during the blight pandemic and (2) sites that varied in time since the last logging event. Current chestnut abundance and chestnut blight prevalence were assessed in areas where chestnut was known to occur before the blight. Elevation, soil pH, slope, aspect, age of canopy trees, and presence or absence of chestnut stumps indicating selective logging of chestnuts were recorded at each site. Chestnuts were more abundant on sites that had not been selectively logged for pre-blight chestnuts. Chestnut presence was more likely at high elevations (857 m ± 33 m). Chestnut abundance was greater at high elevations (>1000. m) and acidic soils (pH 4-5). Chestnut blight prevalence was not correlated with any measured environmental variable. Rather, 15.1% of all chestnut stems were infected with blight regardless of chestnut density. Thus, higher chestnut abundance is not due to lower mortality from the chestnut blight, although the temporal dynamics of blight infection and stem recovery were not within the scope of this study. This research shows that local rates of chestnut population decline differ between locations with different chestnut logging histories. Chestnut site preferences are better understood within the context of history, and thus teasing apart the effects of disease, logging, and environment will result in more successful chestnut restoration efforts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The main aim of the present study was to estimate genetic variability and the level of genetic control of disease resistance in common ash populations based on progeny testing, and to select resistant populations, families and genotypes for production of reproductive material resistant to dieback caused by Chalara fraxinea. A total of 320 half-sib families from ten Lithuanian and fourteen foreign European Fraxinus excelsior populations have been tested in three progeny trials established in Telsiai, Pakruojis, and Kedainiai State Forest Enterprises. Because of severe attacks by C. fraxinea, only 10% of trees survived in all progeny trials at the age of eight years. Variance analysis of health condition scores revealed significant effect of genetic factors i.e., populations and families. Differences in resistance among populations were significant and ranged up to 52.8-55.1% in a degree of damage and survival rate of populations varying from 0.13 to 0.59. At the age of eight years, genetic family variance components ranged 5.3-7.5%, while the additive coefficients of genetic variation ranged 29.9-38.7% indicating the existence of strong genetic differences in progenies' resistance to C. fraxinea both at populational and family levels. There was a significant site effect on the level of damage which could be due to site conditions and/or different infection pressure from the surrounding stands. However, genotype by environment interaction (G x E) for resistance traits was weak and non significant which indicated that populations and families do not differ much in their performance across environments and thus specific adaptations and genetic variation in ecological response are not pronounced. The obtained high heritability estimates (h2=0.40-0.49±0.03) for health condition indicated that resistance is genetically predetermined and inheritable, and allows forward selection and breeding of the resistant genotypes. Health condition of foreign populations was worse than that of the Lithuanian ones by 17.5-23.5% in degree of damage and by 48.5-73.5% in survival rate which could be a consequence of more advanced process of natural selection in resistance against C. fraxinea in damaged Lithuanian F. excelsior populations. The obtained results demonstrated that strategy of the extended introduction of foreign populations to restore Lithuanian ash stands is of doubtful potential. Only few most resistant foreign genotypes could be selected as potential candidates for breeding of 'synthetic' F. excelsior populations in order to increase genetic diversity. Among the Lithuanian populations, the best in terms of growth characteristics, resistance, survival, and proportion of most healthy individuals were those originating from Ignalina, Pakruojis, Šakiai and Kedainiai. Based on estimated BLUP breeding values, complex breeding indexes and on so-called 'Pyramid selection principle', fifty superior individuals were selected within best families from the best populations for establishing resistant breeding populations of common ash in different provenance regions of Lithuania, as well as for establishing clonal trials and resistant seed orchards of second generation.

AB  - This chapter provides a synthesis of information on potential supply of forest biomass given needs for sustainable development of forestry. Sustainability includes maintenance of water supply, biodiversity, and carbon storage as well as timber products, community development, and recreation. Biomass removals can reduce fire hazard and insect and disease attack, restore forest composition and structure, enhance forest growth, provide revenue for treatments and communities, and offset greenhouse gas emissions. Biological limitations vary by forest condition, ownership, and how stands are regenerated. Limitations maintain water supply, soil nutrients, and biodiversity. There are economic limitations because costs for removals may exceed revenue. One analysis suggests U.S. forest-based biomass supply could be 45 million dry tons per year or more, depending on biomass price. Social targets and limitations are given in federal and state legislation. These include a federal cellulosic fuel target with biomass source restrictions, state-level renewable energy portfolio standards, and state-level forest practice guidelines. Understanding of biological and economic limitations and benefits is developing, particularly at local levels. Social targets and limitations could change. Increases in fossil fuel prices would accelerate efforts to develop understanding of biological limitations and could result in changes to social and economic targets and limitations. © 2011 by American Chemical Society.

AB  - Inappropriate practices of natural resource extraction have degraded forest ecosystems and contributed to the impoverishment of human communities that inhabit them throughout Latin America. The problems created by forest degradation have motivated researchers to integrate rural communities into ecosystem restoration projects. This research was conducted in the geographic-cultural regions of Valle de Tulancingo and Sierra Otomí Tepehua, Hidalgo State, Mexico. Participatory workshops were held with municipal authorities and farmers to analyze causes and possible solutions to degradation of forest ecosystems at the regional and community levels. At the regional level, the causes of forest degradation were land use change, overgrazing, illegal logging, forest fires, and forest pests and diseases. Some municipalities, in coordination with rural communities, have recently implemented environmental education programs, used native species in reforestation, established forest nurseries, and controlled forest fires. At the community level, the same causes of degradation were identified, although local farmers do not recognize land use change as a factor of disturbance. There was greater participation in community workshops than in regional workshops due to social organizations and close family relationships among community members. Participatory techniques proved to be an appropriate means to understand the dynamics of these groups and their integration with authorities and research organizations. This study also proved useful in identifying targets for forest restoration, choosing tree species of interest to local communities, and finding local participants who are willing to undertake these projects at the community and regional levels. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Dew is one of the important water resources on the earth and is beneficial to the survival, growth and development of the plants based on the arid and semiarid environment. The disputed effects of dew on plants, beneficial and harmful, were reviewed in this study. The beneficial effects mainly consist of five aspects: (1) Supplying important water resource. In the arid and semiarid regions or in the dry season, dew is the main or the only water resource because of its higher frequency and sustaining time comparing with the precipitation, which keeps the organic synthesis and metabolism, accelerates the increase of biomass in plants. (2) Regulating inner water of plants. The function of dew on regulating inner water of plants includes the following several aspects based on related studies: helping plant to rapidly activate photosynthetic activity during desiccation and rehydration; supplying a moisture environment in repairing embryo DNA of seeds, maintaining seed viability under harsh desert conditions; regulating the transpiration pressure and helping the wilting plant arrive a higher steady restoration state; etc. (3) Improving water balance of soil. There is an indirect effect of dew on plant through improving water balance of soil. On one hand, dew forms on the soil surface or drops into the soil from the nearby plants, becoming an importing water resource. On the other hand, the soil evaporation decreases along with dew event appears, leading a mitigation of soil water tension to some extent. (4) Regulating growing environment of forest plants. The regulation effect appears on canopy firstly, and then into the forest. Dew deposition increases the water resource of forest, improves its water cycle. Along with the dew deposition and evaporation, the forest micro-climate changes, especially the wind speed, moisture and heat. Dew, as a medium, is concerned with the water-heat exchange process of the forest. (5) Dew was used widely in the performing process of foliage dressing, defoliant and pesticide for its characteristics including small dew amount, long time sustaining on objects, leading an accreting of long time, extending the time of sterilization. The harmful effects mainly consist of two aspects: (1) Inducing plant disease. The pathogen of fungus and bacteria releases spores and infects the host plant under a moisture condition, and induces plant disease easily, thus dew supplies opportunities for pathogen. The infection intensity differs from the differences of dew quantity and sustaining time. (2) Reducing output and quality of crops. The influence on the output and quality of crops is related to the quantity, sustaining time, acidification level of dew. The plant stomata movement was inhibited and the route of pollen diffusing was discouraged when the quantity and sustaining time of dew arrive at a higher level. Acid dew could lead to a degradation of vegetation for the decreasing of CO2 assimilation efficiency. Furthermore, the black spot disease of fruit could be induced by dew. The main problems in related researches were also pointed out in present paper. For example, the information of dew action effect on plants was absent; few documents referred to the changing environment, such as urban heat island and the polluted atmosphere etc; researches of dew on plant diversity and the use on biological control were lack. Future studies were recommended to (1) researches of the action effect and mechanisms of dew on plants; (2) researches on the interactions of dew and plants based on the interferential factors including acid dew and the urban heat island effect; (3) researches of the influence of dew on the plant diversity; (4) applied researches on controlling harmful plants using dew.

AB  - The focus of this paper is on how popular representations of the countryside provide countryside users with a discursive framework to make sense of unfamiliar countryside-based risks, taking Lyme disease as an example. Sixty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted with 82 visitors in Richmond Park, New Forest, and Exmoor National Park in the UK. The data were analysed using thematic analysis and was informed by social representations theory. The analysis indicated that a lay understanding of the risk of Lyme disease was filtered by place-attachment and the social representations of the countryside. Lyme disease was not understood primarily as a risk to health, but was instead constructed as a risk to the social and restorative practices in the context of the countryside. The findings suggest that advice about zoonoses such as Lyme disease is unlikely to cause panic, and that it should focus on the least intrusive preventative measures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biological control using host-specific natural enemies is sometimes the only long-term and cost-effective option to contain dominant invasive alien species in natural ecosystems. To assess biocontrol success, most monitoring studies focus on the negative impacts of the released biocontrol agents on the target invasive species. Very few studies have shown the conservation benefits, i.e. their positive effects on the recovery of native species and habitats. A fungal pathogen (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. miconiae) was successfully released on the island of Tahiti (South Pacific) to control the dominant invasive tree Miconia calvescens which forms dense monospecific stands in native rain- and cloud forests. The pathogen causes a leaf disease leading to partial (5-35%) defoliation of Miconia canopy trees. We studied the demographical parameters of the rare endemic sub-shrub Ophiorrhiza subumbellata, growing in the understory of montane cloud forests invaded by Miconia. We compared Ophiorrhiza populations in 13 plots set up in two sites located between 950 and 1000. m elevation, having the same Miconia invasion degree but different levels of leaf damage. Our results showed that, whereas the total population density of Ophiorrhiza is not affected, plants' growth and fertility were significantly higher in more defoliated Miconia forests. A 3-year-long survey of Ophiorrhiza population at one study site indicated that the number of seedlings and juvenile plants increased, suggesting better recruitment and survival. This study demonstrates that biological control has contributed to the recovery of an endemic plant directly threatened by an invasive species, and may be considered as an important management tool for the partial restoration of native forests. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marshall) Borkh.), once a major component of eastern forests from Maine to Georgia, was functionally removed from the forest ecosystem by chestnut blight (an exotic fungal disease caused by Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr), first identified at the beginning of the twentieth century. Hybrid-backcross breeding programs that incorporate the blight resistance of Chinese chestnut (Castenea mollissima Blume) and Japanese chestnut (Castenea crenata Sieb & Zuc.) into American chestnut stock show promise for achieving the blight resistance needed for species restoration. However, it is uncertain if limitations in tissue cold tolerance within current breeding programs might restrict the restoration of the species at the northern limits of American chestnut's historic range. Shoots of American chestnut and hybrid-backcross chestnut (i.e., backcross chestnut) saplings growing in two plantings in Vermont were tested during November 2006, February 2007, and April 2007 to assess their cold tolerance relative to ambient low temperatures. Shoots of two potential native competitors, northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum L.), were also sampled for comparison. During the winter, American and backcross chestnuts were approximately 5°C less cold tolerant than red oak and sugar maple, with a tendency for American chestnut to be more cold tolerant than the backcross chestnut. Terminal shoots of American and backcross chestnut also showed significantly more freezing damage in the field than nearby red oak and sugar maple shoots, which showed no visible injury. © 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - Disease resistance, shade tolerance, and high economic and wildlife value make western redcedar (Thuja plicata) a desirable component of commercial forests in Southwest Washington. Due to heavy ungulate browse, achieving survival and tree heights above browse level (1.4 m) are major reforestation challenges. We studied the effects of two repellents, Plantskydd® and Deer Away Big Game Repellent® (BGR), applied to seedlings at the nursery on tree survival and subsequent six year height growth. In 2003 five sites in southwest Washington were planted with adjacent 10-tree rows of Plantskydd, BGR and a control replicated five times at each site for a total of 150 trees per site. Both repellents kept browse levels low during the first growing season. Treated trees were on average 2-3 cm taller (5-7 cm more growth) than the control. Half of the repellent-treated trees were retreated with BGR in early December after the first growing season. After six growing seasons, there are no significant differences in survival with 80 to 83% of the trees still alive. Trees treated two times with repellents are significantly larger (73 cm) than trees treated once or the control (both 67 cm). Only 2.5% of all surviving trees have reached or exceeded 1.4 m in height and 14% are between 1 and 1.4 m. 22% of all surviving trees are shorter after six growing seasons than when they were planted. Three of the sites were chemically site prepared before planting. Regardless of treatment, trees planted on sites with chemical site preparation had higher survival (85% versus 77%), were significantly taller (71 cm versus 64 cm) and had a higher percentage of trees exceeding 1.4 m (3.7% versus 0.9%) than non-treated sites. Planting western redcedar without physical protection in southwest Washington will cause substantial reforestation delays. Management of competing vegetation and the repeated application of repellents significantly improve western redcedar growth. A combination of site preparation, physical protection or repeated application of repellants will most likely be required for success.

AB  - Restoration of longleaf pine-dominated uplands is common on many public and private lands throughout the southeastern United States. The once dominant longleaf pine ecosystem is important to many now-threatened and endangered plant and animal species, and land managers are increasing efforts to reestablish this fire-dependent forest. Unfortunately, tree mortality in longleaf pine has been observed following attempts to re-introduce prescribed fire. Root-inhabiting ophiostomatoid fungi and their insect vectors have invaded roots of symptomatic longleaf pine. Although, the relationship between ophiostomatoid fungi and longleaf pine roots is poorly understood. In order to assess the pathogenicity and virulence of four ophiostomatoid fungi to longleaf pine, trees within two broad age classes (20-30 and 40-60 years) were used for root inoculations during the fall of 2006 and 2007 along with the spring of 2007 and 2008. All fungal species consistently caused resin-filled, discolored lesions on the phloem surface extending to the xylem. The successful inoculation of healthy longleaf pine roots confirms the pathogenicity of Grosmannia huntii, Leptographium procerum, Leptographium serpens, and Leptographium terebrantis. G. huntii caused the largest lesions, including 22.20cm2, 13.37cm2, and 9.21cm2 larger than L. procerum, L. terebrantis, and L. serpens respectively. In contrast, L. procerum caused significantly smaller lesions than all other fungi, including 8.65cm2 smaller than L. terebrantis and 10.69cm2 smaller than L. serpens. Restoration efforts of longleaf pine may be affected by fungal root infection in the future. Future studies should focus on the interactions between stress factors associated with longleaf pine to define more clearly the ecological role of root-inhabiting ophiostomatoid fungi in the ecosystem. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Populations of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) are under threat from nonnative blister rust disease (Cronartium ribicola), mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and climatic change throughout most of its range. Whitebark pine provides habitat for dozens of high-mountain plant and animal species and is a uniquely picturesque tree for thousands of visitors in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains every year. Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, supports the most extensive lakeside population of this species known. Findings acquired through annual monitoring indicate that healthy whitebark pine trees are declining by about 1% annually since 2003. Combined with a nearly one-third reduction in whitebark pine since the estimated spread of blister rust to Crater Lake in the 1930s, a continued downward trajectory indicates a significant loss of the species. Measures to protect and restore whitebark pine can include developing blister rust resistance, outplanting disease-resistant seedlings, and applying beetle deterrents.

AB  - Preserving forests in the area around an electric transmission facility is an important aspect of environmental management in an electric power industry. Planting of tree seedlings is a reliable method for restoring degraded forest, but a large amount of money and time will be required. Regeneration from naturally dispersed seeds is considered to be an economical and ecologically sound method for forest restoration. However, the restoration success is not guaranteed because many factors affect tree seedling establishment. In this study, we applied an adaptive-management-based process for forest regeneration. As a model case, we considered an area in which the pine wilt disease has been spreading, and we proposed a management practice for seedling establishment in this area. The first step of this approach is to set the target species. In this step, we constructed a predictive model for a regenerable forest type and obtained a mapping by using a GIS on the basis of the relationship between vegetation and environment. Japanese deciduous oak (Quercus serrata) was selected as the target forest species on the basis of the results of a model based on a classification tree. The second step is to develop a management practice. We placed the experimental plots protected from any human disturbance to promote seedling establishment from surrounding natural forest. The third step is monitoring; many seedlings of the target species were recorded in the first year. However, the monitored seedlings died within four years. An analysis of the factors affecting the survival rate of seedlings revealed that dwarf bamboo cover prevented the establishment of natural oak seedlings. In order to promote seedling establishment of the target oak, understory dwarf bamboo should be removed by mowing. The last step is evaluation and feedback. We analyzed monitoring data to determine the most effective mowing frequency. Future change of establishment suitability was simulated by Markov chain modeling. Simulation results suggest that mowing at intervals of two or three years is most effective for controlling dwarf-bamboo growth and promoting oak seedling establishment. Our adaptive-management-based process that involves setting a target species, developing a management practice, monitoring and evaluating the data obtained from this process, and obtaining feedback is considered to enable efficient forest restoration from natural seedlings. The proposed method can be widely used for forest restoration in areas around power transmission facilities and is expected to help reduce the cost of vegetation management for corridors.

AB  - It is of great scientific theory applying value in scientifically understanding the suitable habitat humidity characteristics of different wetlands plants, wetland protection and restoration and containing wetlands ecological degradation to study the change of soil water environmental gradient characteristics with the geomorphic gradient in the wetlands in inland plain and the soil moisture spatial variation in different plant ecosystem types. According to the monitoring data of soil water, the spatial and temporal patterns characteristics of wetland soil moisture are analyzed in a typical small depression of dish shape in the section 135 of Honghe Reserve. The results show that the geomorphic gradient descends and there are significant differences in soil moisture from the island forest on the edge to the swamp in the center of the depression throughout the growing season. On the whole, the soil moisture descends with the geomorphic gradient although there are different trends at different depths in the soil. In addition, the wetness indices of the same area are calculated based on TOPMODEL and DEM. The numerical simulation method is used to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of the regional soil moisture and the differences are further analyzed between the field monitoring data and the computer numerical simulation data. The study is of guiding significance in strengthening the quantitative research and numerical simulation technology of wetland science.

AB  - Invasive alien species pose one of the highest threats to biodiversity, especially in isolated oceanic islands where high rates of both endemism and extinction risk also usually prevail. Few studies have investigated the impact of invasive alien plants on butterflies in insular ecosystems, despite butterflies representing a key indicator group for terrestrial arthropod diversity. Using the Pollard Technique, we quantified butterfly species richness and abundance in eight wet lowland forest areas invaded by alien plants, principally the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum Sabine) on the tropical volcanic island of Mauritius, and compared the results with paired adjacent forest plots that had been weeded of alien plants between 2 and 12 years previously. Butterfly assemblages in weed-infested and weeded forests were distinctly different with higher species richness and much higher butterfly abundance in the latter. At least some of these differences seemed attributable to weed removal effects on forest structure, but understanding the precise mechanisms involved will require further study. The results suggest that alien plant invasion may have contributed to the extinction of certain endemic taxa and can increase the likelihood of butterfly species extinction by reducing population sizes through reduced habitat quality. Such a shift in a forest's butterfly assemblage is likely to have negative effects on both their indigenous predators and the plants they pollinate. It is argued that in order to maintain butterfly and other arthropod diversity and function in these forests, alien plant control must be maintained and extended beyond the current 1% of surviving forest remnants. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V.2010.

AB  - Forest restoration requires an understanding of the natural disturbance regime of the target community and estimates of the historic range of variability of ecosystem components (composition, structure, and disturbance processes). Management prescriptions that support specific restoration activities should be consistent with these parameters. In this study, we describe gap-phase dynamics of even-aged, second-growth red spruce-northern hardwood stands in West Virginia that have been significantly degraded following early Twentieth Century harvesting and wildfire. In the current stage of stand development, gaps tended to be small, with mean canopy gap and extended canopy gap sizes of 53.4m2 and 199.3m2, respectively, and a canopy turnover rate of 1.4%year-1. The majority of gaps resulted from the death of one or two trees. American beech snags were the most frequent gap maker, partially due to the elevated presence of beech-bark disease in the study area. Gaps ranged in age from 1 to 28 years, had a mean of 13 years, and were unimodal in distribution. We projected red spruce to be the eventual gap filler in approximately 40% of the gaps. However, we estimated that most average-sized gaps will close within 15-20 years before red spruce canopy ascension is projected (30-60 years). Accordingly, many understory red spruce will require more than one overhead release - an observation verified by the tree-ring record and consistent with red spruce life history characteristics. Based on our observations, silvicultural prescriptions that include overhead release treatments such as thinning from above or small gap creation through selection harvesting could be an appropriate activity to foster red spruce restoration in the central Appalachians. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since the introduction prior to 1915 of white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) into the forests of western North America, many populations of native white pine species have seriously declined. Because western white pine (Pinus monticola) and sugar pine (P. lambertiana) are highly valued timber species, their silviculture under intensive management is well-documented. The silviculture of other white pine species has received less attention but is no less important. For all western species, silvicultural management is a key component for sustaining and restoring viable white pine populations. This review examines approaches for assessing and reducing blister rust hazard, regenerating white pine stands, and tending established stands to reduce damage and impact from blister rust. Hazard and risk ratings provide means for assessing the potential severity of blister rust infestation and its probable impacts on management. An epidemiological simulation model is available for describing complex pathosystem interactions, their consequences on white pine growth and survival, and likely outcomes of silvicultural activities. Until the 1960s, Ribes eradication was the principal method for blister rust control; it is now rarely used except for high-value trees. The choices of harvest and site preparation methods are critical for successful white pine regeneration. As host responses to blister rust infection are inherited, regeneration is an opportunity to increase seedling survival and disease resistance. For artificial regeneration, the western genetics programmes provide improved planting stock. For natural regeneration, the selection and retention of well-adapted white pines as seed sources can enhance stand genetics. Thinning and pruning are common silvicultural activities for tending stands and are readily modified for blister rust-infested stands. Although biological and chemical agents have been used, their performance has been less than satisfactory. Likewise, genetics and other silvicultural practices have also demonstrated limited success in blister rust control. An alternative, adaptive approach could use both silvicultural and genetic techniques to mitigate impacts and maintain white pines. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH and Crown Copyright.

AB  - The introduced pathogen Cronartium ribicola, cause of white pine blister rust, has spread across much of western North America and established known infestations within all but one species of white pine endemic to western Canada and the United States. Blister rust damage to severely diseased trees reduces reproduction and survival. Severe losses in white pine populations have resulted in site conversions to other species and seriously impacted resource values for timber, wildlife, watershed, recreation, aesthetic and other ecosystem services. In addition to blister rust, other major forest health threats and challenges to sustaining or restoring white pine populations are infestations of other pathogens, insects, fire, management practices that favour other tree species, and climatic change. Recent, large-scale outbreaks of mountain pine beetle have raised concerns for the viability of some white pine populations. In the 1960s, forest disease management for western white pine and sugar pine shifted from Ribes eradication to planting seedlings selected for better survival and resistance to blister rust. Seed orchards for producing improved white pines have been established, but deployment of that improved stock is hampered by a lack of planting opportunities. The inheritance and mechanisms of resistance are best known for western white pine and sugar pine; but new work is extending an understanding of genetics to all the western species of white pine. Current management efforts are focused on locating and protecting individual trees resistant to blister rust and assessing their disease resistance and other adaptive traits. In response to the threats from blister rust, the strategic goal is to sustain or restore viable white pine populations in western forest ecosystems. The four action components of the strategy are: (1) conserve genetic resistance to C. ribicola; (2) reduce the risk of adverse impact in stands currently uninfested; (3) restore and maintain white pines where blister rust is causing impacts and (4) assess and monitor the health and management of white pines. Successful implementation requires long-term support for coordinated efforts of management and research agencies, forest industry and an informed public. Published 2010.

AB  - Agro-silvopastoral land-use has a long tradition throughout Europe. Depending on the region, wood-pasture occurs as vanishing relic of historical land-use, or still more or less widespread as multiple-use rangeland. A new development is that former intensively managed land is being left to evolve towards wood-pasture as an economically and ecologically favourable alternative. In a review of European wood-pasture habitats we distinguish 24 types based on the geobotanical criteria of region, structure, land-use and tree species composition. The European wood-pasture types may be classified as hemiboreal and boreal (4 types), nemoral old-growth (7), nemoral scrub and coppice (5), meridional old-growth (2), meridional scrub and coppice (4), and grazed orchards (2). Wood-pasture forms part of the cultural heritage of Europe, and may add significantly to the preservation of regional biodiversity. The role of wood-pasture in ecological restoration planning and the possibilities of maintaining or enhancing features of wood-pasture deserve more recognition. Many wood-pastures suffer from regeneration failure and are over-mature. Other threats to wood-pasture include abandonment, intensification, oak disease, overgrazing and clearance. In the European Union Habitats Directive, wood-pasture habitats are represented but rather inconsistently. We suggest neglected wood-pasture habitat types to be considered for inclusion. Wood-pasture may form an important element for the economic integrity of rural areas aiming to improve ecological quality, provided they are managed sustainably. © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - American Forests group was initiated to protect the existing forests of the country from unnecessary waste. The group has several achievements such as Chegg plants over 3 million Global ReLeaf trees in 3 years, Global ReLeaf reaches a total of 33+ million trees planted in restoration projects around the world in the year 2010, and sets a new target of 100 million by 2020. The group established the California Wildfire ReLeaf program to plant trees in areas deforested by the wildfires that plague the state in the year 2004. The group joined Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and other partners in an effort to plant trees in Afghanistan, with the goal of revitalizing orchards, nurseries, woodlots and greenbelts. The organization had always had an interest in and connection to urban forestry, regularly publishing articles on the topic in its magazine, and leading national campaigns to address issues such as Dutch elm disease.

AB  - To assess the influence of witches' broom on the structure of bamboo forests, we evaluated the damage inflicted by this disease on bamboo plants and determined the species composition and species richness (number of species) of bamboo forests. Based on the degree of damage inflicted, bamboo forests were assigned to four transition phases: "normal", "infection", "dieback", and "restoration". During the transition from the normal to the dieback phase, coverage in the tree layer decreased by half and the number of species doubled as the extent of bamboo damage increased. In contrast, during the transition from the dieback to the restoration phase, coverage in the shrub layer rapidly increased tenfold, due to the regeneration of small bamboo culms, whereas the number of species decreased by half. These results indicate that witches' broom in bamboo plants has a transient positive effect on species richness in bamboo forests during the early phase of the disease but has a negative impact in the long term. After the restoration phase, bamboo forests are expected to succeed the pioneer community within a short period of time; however, over the long term, species-poor lucidophyllous forests would dominate.

AB  - The main forest transitions that took place in south-central Chile from the end of the last glaciation to the present are reviewed here with the aim of identifying the main climatic and socio-economic drivers of land cover change. The first great transition, driven primarily by global warming, is the postglacial expansion of forests, with human populations from about 15,000 cal. yr. BP, restricted to coastlines and river basins and localized impact of forest fire. Charcoal evidence of fire increased in south-central Chile and in global records from about 12,000 to 6000 cal. yr. BP, which could be attributed at least partly to people. The subsequent expansion of agriculture led to much clearing of forests and the spread of weeds and other indicators of open habitats. The Spanish colonial period in America may have been followed by a transient expansion of forest cover into abandoned land, as indigenous population declined rapidly due to disease and slaughter. The 18th and 19th centuries brought about extensive loss of forests due to the massive impact of lumber extraction for mining operations both in central Chile and in western North America. Two centuries of intensive deforestation, coupled to grazing by cattle and extremely variable rainfall had long-lasting effects on forest cover in south-central Chile, which persist until today. The transition from a preindustrial to an industrial society brought about the "golden age" of timber harvest, assisted by mobile sawmills and railway transportation since the late 1800s. These advances led to the exhaustion of native commercial timber by the late 20th century in south-central Chile. In North America, harvestable stands were exhausted in New England and the Midwest around 1920. Settlement of the independent territories in the late 1800s and early 1900s implied vast burning and clearing of land and mounting soil erosion. Industrial forestry, based on government-subsidized massive plantations of short-rotation exotic trees, developed in the late 20th century, in connection with postindustrial displacement of exploitative activities from developed to third-world nations. In the last two decades, economic globalization and free trade promoted the expansion of new crops and further decline of woodlands, despite modest increases in forest cover. These patterns are repeated in many Latin American countries. To prevent further depletion of native forest resources and to provide an insurance against climate change, in the 21st century developing nations should aim at: (1) relocating subsidies from fiber farms to restoring diverse forest cover, (2) promoting ecosystem management of diverse forest and crops within landscapes, and (3) fostering diverse cultural relationships between people and their land. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The structure of the floodplain forests of the Middle Ebro River (NE Spain) was examined at patch and landscape scales along a three-step chronosequence defined according to the extent of flow regulation-induced hydrogeomorphic changes, with the ultimate purpose of producing baseline information to guide through management and restoration plans. At patch scale, a total of 6,891 stems within 39 plots were registered for species, diameter and health status. The stem density, size class distribution, canopy dieback and mortality were further compared by means of non-parametric tests. At landscape scale, the temporal evolution of the area occupied by forest stands of different ages in the floodplain along the chronosequence was evaluated using four sets of aerial photographs dated in 1927, 1957, 1981 and 2003. The within-patch structure of pioneer forests (<25-30 years old) was characterized by dense and healthy populations of pioneer species (Populus nigra, Salix alba and Tamarix spp.), but the area occupied by these forest types has progressively decreased (up to 37%) since the intensification of river regulation (ca. 1957). In contrast, non-pioneer forests (>25-30 years old) were characterized by declining and sparse P. nigra-S. alba-Tamarix spp. stands, where late-seral species such as Ulmus minor and Fraxinus angustifolia were frequent, but only as small-size stems. At landscape scale, these type of senescent forests have doubled their surface after river regulation was intensified. Populus alba only appeared in the oldest plots recorded (colonized before 1957), suggesting sexual regeneration failure during the last five decades, but usually as healthy and dense stands. Based on these findings, measures principally aimed at recovering some hydrogeomorphic dynamism are recommended to guarantee the self-sustainability of the floodplain forest ecosystem. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Importance to the field: Acamprosate, marketed under the brand name Campral®, (Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Saint Louis, MO, USA; Merck Sante s.a.s., Lyon, France) is an orally administered drug approved in the US and throughout much of the world for treating alcohol dependence. Its safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials worldwide and as with all pharmacotherapies for alcoholism, it is used in conjunction with psychosocial interventions. Areas covered in this review: This article reviews the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy and safety of acamprosate in Phase I, II and III randomized controlled trials involving healthy and alcohol-dependent populations using published reports from 1984 to 2009. What the reader will gain: This review provides an update of the mechanism of action and the safety and efficacy profile of acamprosate. Take home message: Acamprosate appears to act centrally to restore the normal activity of glutamatergic neurotransmission altered by chronic alcohol exposure. Acamprosate's excellent safety profile along with several pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics make it well suited for treating a broad population of alcohol-dependent patients. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd ISSN.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess forest biodiversity in the Sudanese Kordofan Region, identify threats, and suggest alleviation measures. The study revealed that Kordofan region encompasses diverse forestry species (more than 183 trees and shrub species) both indigenous and exotic. These species play a vital role in the economy of the region. They provide almost all the energy needs in terms of firewood and charcoal, timber for construction and building materials, foreign exchange from the sale of gum arabic and other gums and they serve as sources of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for rural people. Furthermore, they are the key components for the sustainability of the traditional smallholder agricultural systems. Many biotic and abiotic factors threaten forestry biodiversity in Kordofan Region. The most important ones include: drought; soil related factors; fire; grazing; expansion of cultivation (traditional and mechanized); illicit woodcutting for timber and other domestic purposes; lack of awareness of deforestation problems; inadequate aforestation activities; inadequate forestry extension and; road construction. Genetic erosion has occurred in many parts of the natural Kordofan forest ranges. Measures and activities to restore, maintain, and enhance forest biodiversity in the region are suggested. High priority should be given to studies on changes of vegetation composition and extent of genetic erosion. Further effort should start by planning for the conservation of the priority species and the endangered ones and then implementation of conservation plans. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Willows have been growing in Kashmir valley and other adjoining temperate areas of India since time immemorial. The willow constituted an important tree species to mankind in view of its multipurpose usage. Willows are easy to grow under moist habitats having adequate sunshine. Historical facts relating to planting of willows by Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Leh and by other personalities elsewhere and also willow wood footwear used by saints and rishis (sages) of Kashmir treated as relics are presented. Introduction of wicker and bat willows from England during early 20th century and their multiplication in suitable areas of Kashmir valley acted as a boon to the willowbased cottage industry. Intensification of willow culture in specified belts by Jammu and Kashmir Forest Department during early periods to cater the fuel needs of Srinagar and other towns till the introduction of LPG as a cooking medium and subsequent use of willow wood for box-making and packing of fruits for export has been elaborated. Traditional practices adopted for willow cultivation, the existing germplasm, pests, diseases and abiotic factors that are considered detrimental for quality bat wood production in the recent past have been listed. Current scenario and efforts made for restoring the past glory of Kashmir bat willow industry have been discussed.

AB  - The US is investing in projects that restore and protect forests, improve recreational facilities, and employ young people to ease the burden of recession. The mission of the United States Forest Service is to sustain the health, diversity and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. The Forest Service manages a system of national forests and grasslands covering 77 million hectares, about 8% of the US land area. Forest Service researchers work closely with national forest managers to plan fuels and forest health treatments for landscapes beleaguered by such growing threats as invasive species, pest, and disease infestations all exacerbated by climate change. The President of the United States signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) into law in February 2009. The Forest Service is using ARRA funds to address the threat by reducing excess fuels and restoring forest health.

AB  - The Longleaf Alliance, which is a private nonprofit organization that works to conserve, restore, and manage functioning Longleaf pine ecosystems, has used to deliver training to forestry professionals and private landowners in US. forests. Activities include restoring Longleaf pine on state-owned and private lands, increasing production capacity of Longleaf pine seed, seedlings, and native under- story plants, and coordinating efforts. The private land to be planted will be identified with a focus on those lands damaged by tornadoes in 2008 and 2009. Stimulus funds will be made available to contract the fumigation and cone collection for the additional capacity needed. Reforestation for pulp and lumber needs was largely performed with faster-growing Slash and Loblolly pines. Forestry officials are in favor of restoring Longleaf pine forests, which the officials say are highly valued for their resistance to damage by insects, diseases, wildfire, and storms and for their yield of high-quality wood products, biological diversity, and beauty.

AB  - After more than 50 years of research and selective breeding, blight-resistant American chestnut (Castanea dentata) trees will soon be available for planting into the species' pre-blight range. Increased understanding of the regeneration requirements of pure American chestnut (C. dentata [Marsh.] Borkh.) will increase the success of future efforts to establish blight-resistant chestnut. We quantified survival and initial growth of bare-root American chestnut seedlings at five locations in eastern Kentucky, USA. We used a split-plot design to compare seedlings planted within adjacent mesic and xeric sites treated with either a two-age shelterwood overstory treatment or a midstory removal treatment. The silvicultural treatments and topographic settings allowed us to evaluate chestnut seedling performance under four light and site productivity combinations. Seedling survival was 57% and seedling height averaged 94 cm following two growing seasons. Seedling survival was negatively related to sand and coarse fragment content, but was unrelated to silviculture treatment or topographic position. Chestnut seedlings grew best in shelterwood overstory treatments areas on mesic sites. Seedlings growing in shelterwood overstory treatment areas added 3- and 3.5-times more height and stem increment compared to seedlings planted after midstory removal. Seedling leaf mass and foliar nitrogen (N) content were also greatest in shelterwood plantings on mesic sites. The high-light environment created by shelterwood overstory removal resulted in better initial seedling growth, but the moderate-light of the midstory removal treatment may ultimately provide chestnut seedlings a greater advantage over competing vegetation.

AB  - American chestnut (castanea dentata) was once a dominant hardwood species in the eastern United States, growing from Maine to Georgia and west to the Ohio Valley (Harlow et al. 1979). Arguably, American chestnut may have been the most important hardwood species in North America, renowned for its quick growth, massive size, and great utility (Harlow et al. 1979). Unfortunately, within 50 years of the introduction of chestnut blight (cryphonectria parasitica)-a fungal disease native to Asia-American chestnut was functionally removed as an overstory tree from eastern forests (Griffin 2000). Owing to the economic and ecological value of American chestnut, several methods of species restoration have been attempted, including biological control of chestnut blight through pathogen hypovirulence, and intra- and interspecific breeding (Griffin 2000). Of the methods attempted thus far, backcross breeding has shown the most promise for near-term, comprehensive species restoration (Griffin 2000). Backcross breeding involves an initial cross of American and Asian chestnut (usually Chinese [castanea mollissima]), followed by backcrossing hybrid offspring with additional American chestnut parents, which increases the proportion and diversity of American chestnut genes in the breeding pool. The goal is to breed a tree that is extremely similar in genotype and phenotype to American chestnut while capturing the blight-resistance genes of Asian chestnuts. © 2009 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - The Oahu elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis ibidis) is an endangered forest bird endemic to the Hawaiian island of Oahu (USA) and is threatened by nest predation from alien rodents and mosquito-borne diseases. I investigated importance of these threats and evaluated success of conservation efforts from 1995 to 2008. I controlled rodents with snap-traps and bait stations in 3 valleys and switched sites from non-treatment to treatment over time. I mist-netted and color-banded 91 elepaio, inspected them for symptoms of avian poxvirus (Poxvirus avium), and estimated survival using multistate markrecapture models. I determined annual fecundity of each breeding pair and monitored success of 212 nests. The oldest known Oahu elepaio was ≥15 years old. Survival of females was higher with rodent control (0.82 ± 0.05) than without (0.55 ± 0.12), but survival of males was not affected by rodent control (0.86 ± 0.02 with vs. 0.84 ± 0.04 without). Survival of elepaio with active or inactive pox-like lesions was 410 lower than survival of elepaio with no pox symptoms. Rodent control resulted in higher annual fecundity (0.69 ± 0.05 vs. 0.33 ± 0.06 fledglings/pair) and nest success (62 vs. 33). Female site-fidelity, mate fidelity, and female encounter probability were lower in the absence of rodent control because more females switched territories and mates after nest failure. Population growth calculated from survival and fecundity estimates was stable with rodent control (1.07 ± 0.04) but declining without rodent control (0.69 ± 0.05). Elepaio numbers have continued to decline despite rodent control, probably because some young birds disperse into adjacent unmanaged areas that act as sinks. The best immediate management strategy for Oahu elepaio is to conduct rodent control over larger areas. Restoration of native forest would benefit elepaio by providing nest sites that are less attractive to rodents. Construction of predator-proof fences and eradication of predators would provide the best long-term protection for elepaio.

AB  - Forest management activities may help reduce global net CO2 concentrations by capturing and storing atmospheric CO2. Research related to carbon sequestration potential of plantations in North America has focused predominantly on conifers, with relatively little emphasis thus far on temperate deciduous forest tree species. American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.), a former dominant tree species in eastern North America until its demise associated with the introduced chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr.), is a temperate deciduous species that holds promise for future carbon sequestration programs with expected availability of blight-resistant backcross hybrids. We quantified aboveground biomass and bole carbon of American chestnut interplanted with black walnut (Juglans nirga L.) and northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) across four blight-free experimental sites varying in site quality and/or age (8, 8, 12, and 19 years) isolated from the native American chestnut range in the Coulee Region of southwestern Wisconsin, USA. American chestnut exhibited more rapid growth and greater aboveground biomass and bole carbon than either of the other interplanted species. Aboveground biomass ranged from 46.9, 60.7, 55.0, and 179.9 Mg ha-1 for the 8-, 8-, 12-, and 19-year-old sites, respectively, while bole carbon content ranged from 13.6, 18.6, 14.1, and 60.1 Mg ha-1 for the 8-, 8-, 12-, and 19-year-old sites, respectively. Cross-referencing our data to studies conducted within this same physiographic region using other important forestry species (i.e., Populus tremuloides Michx., Pinus resinosa Ait., and Pinus strobus L.) showed that American chestnut compared favorably in growth and carbon uptake. Incorporating American chestnut into carbon sequestration plantations provides additional ecological and economic benefits associated with consistent production of quality nuts for wildlife, valuable timber, and contribution toward species restoration. Our data lend support to building evidence demonstrating rapid and sustained growth of American chestnut and the potential role of plantation-grown American chestnut in helping to mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human-caused disruptions to seed-dispersal mutualisms increase the extinction risk for both plant and animal species. Large-seeded plants can be particularly vulnerable due to highly specialized dispersal systems and no compensatory regeneration mechanisms. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a keystone subalpine species, obligately depends upon the Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) for dispersal of its large, wingless seeds. Clark's Nutcracker, a facultative mutualist with whitebark pine, is sensitive to rates of energy gain, and emigrates from subalpine forests during periods of cone shortages. The invasive fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust, reduces whitebark pine cone production by killing cone-bearing branches and trees. Mortality from blister rust reaches 90% or higher in some whitebark pine forests in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA, and the rust now occurs nearly rangewide in whitebark pine. Our objectives were to identify the minimum level of cone production necessary to elicit seed dispersal by nutcrackers and to determine how cone production is influenced by forest structure and health. We quantified forest conditions and ecological interactions between nutcrackers and whitebark pine in three Rocky Mountain ecosystems that differ in levels of rust infection and mortality. Both the frequency of nutcracker occurrence and probability of seed dispersal were strongly related to annual whitebark pine cone production, which had a positive linear association with live whitebark pine basal area, and negative linear association with whitebark pine tree mortality and rust infection. From our data, we estimated that a threshold level of ;1000 cones/ha is needed for a high likelihood of seed dispersal by nutcrackers (probability -0.7), and that this level of cone production can be met by forests with live whitebark pine basal area .5.0 m2/ha. The risk of mutualism disruption is greatest in northernmost Montana (USA), where three-year mean cone production and live basal area fell below predicted threshold levels. There, nutcracker occurrence, seed dispersal, and whitebark pine regeneration were the lowest of the three ecosystems. Managers can use these threshold values to differentiate between restoration sites requiring planting of rust-resistant seedlings and sites where nutcracker seed dispersal can be expected. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Dothistroma needle blight, one of the most important foliar diseases of Pinus spp., is caused primarily by the fungus Dothistroma septosporum (Dorog.) Morelet, and to a lesser extent by Dothistroma pini Hulbary. The potential distribution and abundance of Dothistroma spp. was determined by (i) developing a process-oriented model of potential distribution of Dothistroma spp. from known locations, (ii) compiling a comprehensive list of susceptible host species from existing scientific literature and (iii) determining the distribution of susceptible hosts in areas predicted to be suitable for range expansion of Dothistroma spp. Using these three sources of information regions at risk were identified as those that were predicted to be suitable for range expansion by Dothistroma spp. and included significant areas of susceptible host species. The process-oriented distribution model, CLIMEX was used to infer the climatic requirements of Dothistroma spp. from laboratory based measurements and 248 disease records in North America and Asia. When validated against 7594 disease observations from Europe, Africa, South America and Oceania, the model correctly predicted that all observations had a suitable climate for Dothistroma spp. The model indicated that the fungi can persist in climates ranging from sub-arctic through temperate, Mediterranean, continental, subtropical to dry tropical regions. The low level of disease detection in many regions projected to be climatically suitable may be due to the low occurrence of susceptible hosts. When areas that were not suitable for susceptible hosts were excluded results suggest that Dothistroma spp. could further extend their range into south east China, Vietnam, Ireland, Western Australia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Panama, Turkey, Albania and many countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) is a major component of the mixed-conifer forests found in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, USA. In the past several decades, sugar pine mortality has increased due to an introduced pathogen, white pine blister rust (caused by Cronartium ribicola). This study described stand development patterns in the mixed-conifer forests and quantified stand and tree growth response to the loss of sugar pine. Stratification patterns tended to follow patterns of shade tolerance with the more shade tolerant species found in lower canopy positions. Growth response was analyzed following the initial entry of blister rust and after more recent sugar pine mortality. Following the initial wave of mortality induced by blister rust, overstory trees and most individual species increased overall basal area growth. Although most species also responded to recent sugar pine mortality (occurring within the past ten years) by increasing basal area growth, the increase was only significant for white fir. Mortality of sugar pine has favored other conifer species, leading to changes in species dominance and negative effects on understory growth of sugar pine; release of these trees could improve overstory recruitment of sugar pine. However, due to the increased growth of white fir, any management strategies aimed at restoring sugar pine must also consider white fir management. © 2009 by the Northwest Scientific Association.

AB  - Pine wood nematode (PWN, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), originating from North America, causes destructive pine wilt disease. Different pine forest ecosystems have different resistances to B. xylophilus, and after its invasion, the resilience and restoration direction of different ecosystems also varies. In this study, an interpretative structural model was applied for analyzing the response of pine forest ecosystem to PWN disturbance. The result showed that a five-degree multi-stage hierarchical system affected the response of the pine forest ecosystem to PWN disturbance, in which direct affecting factors are resistance and resilience. Furthermore, the analysis to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th degree factors showed that not only does distribution pattern of plant species and pine's ecological features affect the resistance of pine forests' ecosystem, but removal of attacked trees and other measures also influence the resistance through indirectly affecting the damage degree of Monochamus alternatus and distribution pattern of plant species. As for resilience, it is influenced directly by soil factors, hydrology, surrounding species provenance and biological characteristics of the second and jointly dominant species, and the climate factors can also have a direct or indirect effect on it by affecting the above factors. Among the fifth elements, the elevation, gradient and slope direction, topographical factors, diversity of geographical location and improvement of prevention technology all influence the response of pine forest ecosystem to PWN disturbance. © 2009 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Orchis mascula (L.) L. (early purple orchid) relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Orchis mascula is a native herb of the British flora. It is mostly found in woodland, copses, grasslands and open pastures, mostly on neutral or base-rich soils. It can also occur in hedgerows, scrub, on roadsides and railway banks, in grikes on limestone pavement and on moist cliff ledges. It is absent from very acid or very wet sites. It tolerates a sparse to moderately dense canopy, but it does not flower in deep shade. 3. Orchis mascula is a non-bulbous geophyte with little or no capacity for vegetative spread. The main perennating organ is a tuber (strictly a rootstem tuber). In most years the tuber generates a rosette of expanded leaves, and, at the end of every year of the plant's life, the tuber is replaced by at least one new tuber. Dormancy, the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, and the subsequent reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons, has been observed, but does not last longer than 1 year. The species is long-lived: it takes at least 4 years from first appearance above-ground to achieve flowering for the first time. The maximum recorded lifetime after first appearance is 13 years. 4. Orchis mascula is not autogamous and pollinators are necessary for successful pollination and fruit set. Flowers are nectarless, and pollinated by deceit, mainly by bumblebees and solitary bees. Natural levels of fruit set are usually < 20%. Hand-pollination can increase fruit set to approximately 80%, indicating that seed production is strongly pollen-limited. The lowest four flowers are more likely to be pollinated than the upper flowers, probably because pollinators learn to avoid the species after discovering that it offers no reward. 5. As in most other European countries, Orchis mascula has declined in the British Isles, although it is not at threat of extinction at a national level. Most sites from which it has been lost are in central England and Scotland. Most losses have been caused by woodland clearance and coniferization, intensification of grassland management and ploughing. The cessation of traditional coppicing practises has also led to a decline in the abundance of O. mascula. Since the species is slow to colonize new forest stands or grasslands, management should focus mainly on conservation of ancient forest habitats and grasslands in which fertility is moderate to low and grazing is absent or low in intensity. Restoration of traditional coppicing practices could also lead to higher chances of the species flowering and surviving in the long-term. © 2009 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Sudden oak death (SOD), caused by the recently discovered non-native invasive pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, has already killed tens of thousands of native coast live oak and tanoak trees in California. Little is known of potential short and long term impacts of this novel plant-pathogen interaction on forest structure and composition. Coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) form mixed-evergreen forests along the northern California coast. This study measured tree mortality over a gradient of disease in three time periods. Direct measurements of current mortality were taken during 2004, representing a point-in-time estimate of present and ongoing mortality. Past stand conditions, c. 1994, were estimated using a stand reconstruction technique. Future stand conditions, c. 2014, were calculated by assuming that, given a lack of host resistance, live trees showing signs of the disease in 2004 would die. Results indicate that coast live oaks died at a rate of 4.4-5.5% year-1 between 1994 and 2004 in highly impacted sites, compared with a background rate of 0.49% year-1, a ten-fold increase in mortality. From 2004 to 2014, mortality rates in the same sites were 0.8-2.6% year-1. Over the entire period, in highly impacted sites, a 59-70% loss of coast live oak basal area was predicted, and coast live oak decreased from 60% to 40% of total stand basal area, while bay laurel increased from 22% to 37%. Future stand structures will likely have greater proportions of bay laurel relative to coast live oak. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Livestock from communities bordered by dune mining, urban areas and commercial forestry in northern KwaZulu-Natal spend substantial time foraging in the coastal forest that the mining company is obliged to restore. A survey of livestock owners and an experimental study of impacts of cattle on restoration processes were conducted to develop better knowledge of the perceptions of livestock owners neighbouring the mine, and the impacts of their cattle on rehabilitating coastal dune forest. Shortages of grazing and livestock diseases were perceived to be the major constraints on livestock operations. Mitigation included grazing cattle in the rehabilitating forest and treating livestock diseases with available medicinal plant species. An exclosure experiment in one of the older stands undergoing restoration showed that cattle grazing reduced grass biomass and Acacia kosiensis seedling recruitment. A study of seeds collected from cattle dung showed that Psidium guajava, an important invasive alien woody species, was dispersed by cattle into the rehabilitating forest, but passage through cattle did not enhance germination of the invasive species. The study concluded that: (1) the proximity of livestock owners to large-scale commercial land uses influenced their perceptions and their resources, and (2) grazing and trampling by cattle in the rehabilitating dune forest may hinder the ecological restoration process.

AB  - Inflammatory reactions in the CNS, resulting from a loss of control and involving a network of non-neuronal and neuronal cells, are major contributors to the onset and progress of several major neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic strategies should therefore keep or restore the well-controlled and finely-tuned balance of immune reactions, and protect neurons from inflammatory damage. In our study, we selected plants of the Malaysian rain forest by an ethnobotanic survey, and investigated them in cell-based-assay-systems and in living brain tissue cultures in order to identify anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. We found that alcoholic extracts from the tropical plant Knema laurina (Black wild nutmeg) exhibited highly anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in cell culture experiments, reduced NO- and IL-6-release from activated microglia cells dose-dependently, and protected living brain tissue from microglia-mediated inflammatory damage at a concentration of 30 μg/ml. On the intracellular level, the extract inhibited ERK-1/2-phosphorylation, IkB-phosphorylation and subsequently NF-kB-translocation in microglia cells. K. laurina belongs to the family of Myristicaceae, which have been used for centuries for treatment of digestive and inflammatory diseases and is also a major food plant of the Giant Hornbill. Moreover, extract from K. laurina promotes also neurogenesis in living brain tissue after oxygen-glucose deprivation. In conclusion, extract from K. laurina not only controls and limits inflammatory reaction after primary neuronal damage, it promotes moreover neurogenesis if given hours until days after stroke-like injury. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The environmental social science sub-disciplines including environmental conflict resolution and the study of environmental laws ascertain conservation policy linked answers to a broad range of management questions. The ensuing discussion examines the premise that concerted and sustained efforts by resource managers will preserve, conserve, and restore renewable resources. The primary target of this examination is that of illuminating the role of the environmental social science sub-disciplines as an adjunct to physical science policy prescriptions for conserving resources. Resource conservation begins when human agents perceive value in protecting a resource. Anthropogenic activity is often the principal driver of renewable resource degradation hence effective resource conservation often places emphasis on ameliorating the social forces causing resource loss and degradation. For example, in post-industrial western societies the change from a late climax forest to an early successional forest is often the result of a manmade fire. Any assessment of the resource management impact of the fire must take into account multiple social facets of the action. The fire may have been set in an effort to achieve a wide variety of goals including: (1) eradicating tree diseases, (2) creating a clearance in the forest canopy that might enhance the habitat for animal species, or (3) improving game habitat and harvests. On the other hand, the fire may have been set by a person seeking local employment as a fireman or planning to plant a crop. Thus, the who, what, and why questions of resource management are integral to even the most bare bones assessment of any resource action. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We record the flowering, fruiting and senescence events of the bamboo Merostachys skvortzovii Sendulsky in the state of Paraná, Brazil. This species is known as "taquara-lixa" and its distribution is widespread, mostly along the "Floresta Ombrófila Mista" (Araucaria forest). Information from herbarium specimens and field observations from 2003 to 2006 showed that the period between reproductive events ranges from 30 to 34 years, and that each event lasts 3-4 years. Throughout 2003 to 2006, the flowering occurred from October to January and the fruition from December to March. This information is important to understand some aspects related to the massive flowering of these bamboos, like the "ratadas" (population outbursts of native rats) and its implications to human diseases, besides population dynamics and restoration of the forests where these plants occur.

AB  - Ask airline passengers what they see as they gaze out the window, and they will describe a fragmented landscape: a patchwork of desert, woodlands, farmlands, and developed neighborhoods. Once-contiguous forests are now subdivided; tallgrass prairies that extended for thousands of miles are now crisscrossed by highways and byways. Whether the result of naturally occurring environmental changes or the product of seemingly unchecked human development, fractured lands significantly impact the planet's biological diversity. In Ecology of Fragmented Landscapes, Sharon K. Collinge defines fragmentation, explains its various causes, and suggests ways that we can put our lands back together. Researchers have been studying the ecological effects of dismantling nature for decades. In this book, Collinge evaluates this body of research, expertly synthesizing all that is known about the ecology of fragmented landscapes. Expanding on the traditional coverage of this topic, Collinge also discusses disease ecology, restoration, conservation, and planning. Not since Richard T. T. Forman's classic Land Mosaics has there been a more comprehensive examination of landscape fragmentation. Ecology of Fragmented Landscapes is critical reading for ecologists, conservation biologists, and students alike. © 2009 The Johns Hopkins University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many orders and families of invertebrates have been promoted as ecological and environmental indicators of management practices and natural disturbances in forest ecosystems. To date most research has focused on ants, particularly for gauging the success of efforts to restore lands modified by human disturbance. However, it is now recognised that a range of taxa are potentially required. Here, beetles, butterflies, ants and spiders have received interest as potential candidates for the 'shopping basket'. Less well known, but of great importance, are responses by the hyperdiverse order Hemiptera (true bugs). Recent research along a latitudinal gradient shows Hemiptera to be one of the best orders of invertebrate at discriminating between different forest types. This paper reviews the benefits of incorporating Hemiptera into ecological studies examining forest management practices. We describe the contribution Hemiptera make as the fifth most speciose insect order to forest biodiversity, their functional role in ecosystems, and their role as forest pests. Hemiptera occur in all forest strata (e.g., soil, leaf-litter, understorey, overstorey). As abundant and diverse prey they are likely to contribute to the high diversity of other arthropods plus insectivorous birds, mammals and reptiles. Although most Hemiptera are herbivorous, the group exhibits a wide spectrum of feeding habits, including predators, fungivores, and parasites. Even within the herbivores there is great variation owing to different host specificity levels, with some species highly monophagous (feeding only from one species of plant), through to species that are highly polyphagous (feeding from different families of plants). As many polyphagous Hemiptera often target plants with high nutrients, individual plants within a species may also differ in their hemipteran assemblages owing to differences in nutrients. This diversity in trophic requirements means that Hemiptera are sensitive to changes not only in habitat structure, but also floristics and changes in plant chemistry. Similarly, seasonal changes can also influence the structure of hemipteran assemblages at spatial scales ranging from individual plants up to forest plots. We review the most efficient methods for sampling Hemiptera, for example, beating, pitfall traps, vacuum sampling, intercept traps and chemical knockdown. We examine current knowledge on the response and recovery of Hemiptera to different forest disturbances, such as fire, fragmentation, windthrow, disease and flood. We then illustrate these points by summarizing studies in a forest system being restored following the severe disturbance of mining. Finally, we detail the role that both introduced and native species of Hemiptera display as pests in forest or silvicultural systems, as outbreaks of Hemiptera can indicate when a system is stressed, particularly by drought or flooding. © 2007 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - In the last few decades we assisted to a significant increase of interest for the chestnut culture in many agroforestry systems. The market potential appears prosperous and this situation gives new impulses for the valorisation of this rural resource. According to this positive trend, high forests have been restored and new orchards planted. Nevertheless in many areas the technological development is weak, pests and diseases threaten the culture and the quality of nut and timber is poor. The study deals with opportunities and problems of the chestnut industry and presents actions and strategies to allow the culture to improve its fundamental role of multipurpose species.

AB  - Although land management over much of the history of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) has emphasized single-species management, recent policy has encouraged land managers to focus on broader ecosystem restoration goals. One framework for forest ecosystem management that is becoming more popular in the NWRS and other federal and state resource agencies has been termed "ecological forestry" - an approach to forest ecosystem management where the focus is on incorporating an understanding of the outcomes of natural disturbances and stand development processes into designing silvicultural practices. This approach stresses understanding the effects of natural disturbances on biological legacies, structural and compositional heterogeneity, and the recovery periods between disturbance events (including how this recovery period influences stand complexity). Recently, resource managers and ecologists from Seney National Wildlife Refuge, The Ohio State University, and Central Michigan University have partnered to examine how these guiding principles can be integrated into NWRS forest ecosystem management. Specifically, we are partnering to develop management strategies to help: 1) restore the once extensive mixed-pine forest ecosystems of eastern Upper Michigan; 2) mitigate the effects of the beech-bark disease complex on American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), a foundation species in northern hardwood forests of eastern North America; and 3) promote more natural forest patterns for wildlife species of young jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forest ecosystems, including the federally endangered Kirtland's warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii). These efforts are ongoing and will continue to be monitored over time. However, initial collaborations suggest that the NWRS provides an excellent crucible to study the application of ecological forestry principles and develop novel ways to manage forest ecosystems. ecological forestry, forest restoration, Kirtland's warbler, National Wildlife Refuge, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

AB  - Introduced mosquito-borne avian disease is a major limiting factor in the recovery and restoration of native Hawaiian forest birds. Annual epizootics of avian pox (Avipoxvirus) and avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) likely led to the extinction of some species and continue to impact populations of susceptible Hawaiian honeycreepers (Drepanidinae). The introduction of a novel pathogen, such as West Nile virus (WNV), could result in further population declines and extinctions. During September and October 2004, we infected Hawaìì Amakihi (Hemignathus virens) with a North American isolate of WNV by needle inoculation and mosquito bite to observe susceptibility, mortality, and illness in this endemic passerine, and to determine the vector competence of the co-occurring, introduced mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. All experimentally infected Hawafìì Amakihi became viremic, with a mean titer &gt;105 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml, and they experienced clinical signs ranging from anorexia and lethargy to ataxia. The fatality rate among needle-inoculated Hawafìì Amakihi (n = .1.6) was 3.1.3%, but mortality in free-ranging birds is likely to increase due to predation, starvation, thermal stress, and concomitant infections of avian malaria and pox. Surviving Hawaìì Amakihi seem to clear WNV from the peripheral blood by 7-10 days postinfection (DPI), and neutralizing antibodies were detected from 9 to 46 DPI. In transmission trials, Hawaiian Cx. quinquefasciatus proved to be a competent vector and Hawafìì Amakihi an adequate amplification host of WNV, suggesting that epizootic WNV could readily become an additional limiting factor of some native Hawaiian bird populations. © Wildlife Disease Association 2009.

AB  - When pine trees are invaded by pine wilt diseases, the severely infected pine trees will die and fall down, or they will be removed when found to be damaged by the disease. It gives rise to the invasion of other species in these empty niches originally occupied by pine trees, i.e., competing surrounding trees or understory shrubs will invade the empty niches during the following years. As a result, the spatial distribution and pattern of the main tree species in a pine forest will change, and a niche variety in the main population will occur. In the end, the direction of the succession and restoration of the pine forest ecosystem will be affected. In our study, a Pinus massoniana forest with the dominant shrub, Pleioblastus amarus, was invaded by pine wood nematode and was clear cut. Selecting this community as our research object, we studied the effect of the invasion of the pine wood nematode on the growth of the dominant shrub, P. amarus, in this Pinus massoniana forest. Our results show that, after the attacked pine trees were removed, the niche was occupied by Pleioblastus amarus and other shrubs, which benefited the growth of P. amarus to its climax. Growth of P. amarus at the climax stage was greater compared with the unhealthy pine forest and the control group. © 2009 Beijing Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi are microbial engines which improve plant vigor and soil quality. They play a crucial role in plant nutrient uptake, water relations, ecosystem establishment, plant diversity, and the productivity of plants. Scientific research involves multidisciplinary approaches to understand the adaptation of mycorrhizae to the rhizosphere, mechanism of root colonization, effect on plant physiology and growth, biofertilization, plant resistance and biocontrol of plant pathogens. This book discusses and goes into detail on a number of topics: the molecular basis of nutrient exchange between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and host plants; the role of AM fungi in disease protection, alleviation of soil stresses and increasing grain production; interactions of AM fungi and beneficial saprophytic mycoflora in terms of plant growth promotion; the role of AM fungi in the restoration of native ecosystems; indirect contributions of AM fungi and soil aggregation to plant growth and mycorrhizosphere effect of multitrophic interaction; the mechanisms by which mycorrhizas change a disturbed ecosystem into productive land; the importance of reinstallation of mycorrhizal systems in the rhizosphere is emphasized and their impact on landscape regeneration, and in bioremediation of contaminated soils; Ectomycorrhizae (ECM) and their importance in forest ecosystems and associations of ECM in tropical rain forests function to maintain tropical monodominance; in vitro mycorrhization of micro-propagated plants, and visualizing and quantifying endorhizal fungi; the use of mycorrhizae, mainly AM and ECM, for sustainable agriculture and forestry. © 2008 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.

AB  - Mycorrhizae establish symbiotic relationships with plants and play an essential role in plant growth, disease protection, and overall soil quality. Of the seven types of mycorrhizae described in current scientific literature (arbuscular, ecto, ectendo, arbutoid, monotropoid, ericoid and orchidaceous mycorrhizae), the arbuscular and ectomycorrhizae are the most abundant and widespread. This chapter presents an overview of current knowledge of mycorrhizal interactions, processes, and potential benefits to society. The molecular basis of nutrient exchange between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and host plants is presented; the role of AM fungi in disease protection, alleviation of heavy metal stress and increasing grain production is also reviewed. Use of mycorrhizae, primarily AM and ectomycorrhizae (ECM), on plant growth promotion and disease suppression are discussed and their implications on sustainable agriculture are considered. The effect of co-inoculation of AM fungi and beneficial saprophytic mycoflora, in terms of plant growth promotion and root colonization, are discussed. The role of AM fungi in the restoration of native ecosystems and the mycorrhizosphere effect of multitrophic interactions are briefly outlined. The mechanisms by which mycorrhizae transform a disturbed ecosystem into productive land are briefly discussed. The importance of reintroduction of mycorrhizal systems in the rhizosphere is emphasiszed and their impact in landscape regeneration and in bioremediation of contaminated soils are discussed. The importance of ECM in forest ecosystems, and associations of ECM in tropical rainforests and their function in maintaining tropical monodominance are discussed. In Vitro mycorrhization of micropropagated plants and visualizing and quantifying endorhizal fungi are briefly explained. © 2008 Springer Netherlands.

AB  - Fire and thinning restoration treatments in fire-suppressed forests often damage or stress leave trees, altering pathogen and insect affects. We compared types of insect- and pathogen-mediated mortality on mixed-conifer trees 3 years after treatment. The number of bark beetle attacked trees was greater in burn treatments compared with no-burn treatments, and in some cases, larger pine trees were preferentially attacked. Restoration treatments are not expected to change the trajectory of spread and intensification of dwarf mistletoe. Thinning treatments may have provided a sanitation effect in which large leave trees have lower levels of dwarf mistletoe. Although thinning treatments are known to exacerbate root disease, <12% of cut stumps were infected with root pathogens (Armillaria gallica and Heterobasidion annosum). Treatments increased Ribes (alternate host for white pine blister rust) frequency and abundance, which may have very localized impacts on white pine blister rust dynamics. In some instances, fire, insects, and pathogens appear to conflict with forest restoration goals by reducing the percentage of pine and producing proportionally higher rates of tree mortality in large-diameter size classes. To better understand the long-term effects of restoration treatments on pathogens and insects, continued monitoring over the course of varying climatic conditions will be needed. © 2008 NRC.

AB  - Forest stand diversification in terms of plant species and spacing of plantings is critical to restoring components of native forests, reducing risks of insect and disease outbreaks, and providing a variety of habitats for native birds and other forest animals. We share the results of experimentation with reforestation practices to achieve more diverse upland forests in northeastern Minnesota. We also share the results of a study to determine the impact of site preparation (rock raking) and seedling "release" (removing competing surrounding vegetation after two years) on survival and height of 19 native trees and shrubs. After five years, seedling survival across the 19 species ranged from 31% to 94%, with mean of 72%. Survival was higher for sites receiving the preparation treatment (76%) than for those not receiving the treatment (68%). Site preparation significantly increased seedling height for eight species. In year three of the study we removed nearby competing vegetation (release treatment), which resulted in significantly greater seedling height for two species and less height growth for three species after two years. We discuss the value of increases in survival and height in the context of overall forest management objectives and other management strategies to diversify forest species and structure. ©2008 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - Morchella esculenta (L) Pers. is an excellently edible and delicious morel mushroom found growing in the temperate forests. The mycelium of this mushroom is widely used as a flavouring agent. The current investigation was undertaken to explore the protective effect of the aqueous-ethanol extract of cultured mycelium of M. esculenta against cisplatin and gentamicin induced acute renal toxicity in Swiss albino mice. Cisplatin and gentamicin when administered induced a marked renal failure, characterized by a significant increase in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. Treatment with the extract at 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight decreased the cisplatin and gentamicin induced increase in serum creatinine and urea levels. Treatment with the extract also restored the depleted antioxidant defense system. The decreased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced glutathione (GSH) in the kidneys consequent to cisplatin and gentamicin administration was significantly elevated. The enhanced renal antioxidant defense system also prevented the tissue lipid peroxidation. The experimental results suggest that aqueous-ethanol extract of morel mushroom, M. esculenta mycelium protected cisplatin and gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity possibly by enhancing renal antioxidant system. The findings thus suggest the potential therapeutic use of morel mushroom mycelium as a novel nephroprotective agent. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduced mosquito-borne pathogens avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum Grassi and Feletti) and avian pox virus (Avipoxvirus) have been implicated in the past extinctions and declines of Hawaiian avifauna and remain significant obstacles to the recovery and restoration of endemic Hawaiian birds. Effective management of avian disease will require extensive mosquito control efforts that are guided by the local ecology of the vector Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae). During October and November 1997 and September through November 1998 five mark-release-recapture experiments with laboratory-reared Cx. quinquefasciatus were conducted in a native rain forest on Hawaii Island. Of the overall 66,047 fluorescent dye-marked and released females, 1,192 (1.8%) were recaptured in 43-52 CO2-baited traps operated for 10-12-d trapping periods. Recaptured mosquitoes were trapped in all directions and at distances up to 3 km from the release site. The cumulative mean distance traveled (MDTs) over the trapping period ranged from a high of 1.89 km after 11 d (September 1998) to a low of 0.81 km after 11 d (November 1998). Released mosquitoes moved predominately in a downwind direction and they seemed to use forestry roads as dispersal corridors. Applying an estimated MDT of 1.6 km to a geographical information system-generated map of the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge clearly demonstrated that the effective refuge area could be reduced 60% by mosquitoes infiltrating into managed refuge lands. These findings should have significant implications for the design of future refuges and development of effective mosquito-borne avian disease control strategies.

AB  - Restoration planning, evaluation, and implementation are important in areas where abiotic disturbances (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes, and ice storms), biotic disturbances (e.g., outbreaks of native and exotic invasive pests and diseases), and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., harvesting, planting, and fire exclusion) have altered forest landscapes. However, the effects of restoration practices are difficult to measure, and restoration goals often are unclear. Landscape modeling provides a tool for evaluating outcomes of various management scenarios and restoration strategies. In this article, we provide a framework for using landscape models for forest restoration. Specifically, we present a case study usin LANDIS, a landscape simulation model of forest disturbance and succession, to explore the effects of restoration strategies for forests damaged by southern pine beetle in the southern Appalachians.

AB  - Beech bark disease (an exotic insect-disease complex of the woolly beech scale, Cryptococcus fagisuga and an ascomycete, Neonectria faginata,) infects American beech (Fagus grandifolia) in the Maritime provinces of Canada and much of the north-eastern United States, and is still spreading. There is no practical chemical control for the beech scale and natural predators are not effective in stopping its spread. Some trees show resistance to beech scale attack. Vegetative propagation of these resistant trees using somatic embryogenesis (SE) will help conserving the gene pool and restore disease-free beech to the forest. Somatic embryogenesis was induced from zygotic embryos and young expanding leaves of mature trees. Zygotic embryos were most responsive to induction treatments, with 0-80% of the explants producing embryogenic tissue (ET). The induction rate was significantly influenced by both the collection date and genotype. Immature cotyledonary stage embryos produced the most ET-an average of 13%. Newly expanded leaves from buds of mature trees also produced ET (two cell lines). The ET was cryopreserved, thawed, and regrown. Gel strength had a significant influence on the number of normal embryos that matured, ranging from 18 embryos g-1 of initial tissue on 0.25% gellan gum, to an average of 147 embryos g-1 on 0.75% gellan gum. Abscisic acid concentration had no significant effect on embryo maturation. After germination the embryos elongated and formed new leaves and in some cases - a primary root. None of the germinated embryos survived transfer to soil.

AB  - Butternut (Juglans cinerea) has been an important component of eastern hardwood forests in North America since the last ice-age, but an exotic fungal pathogen (Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum) has been devastating the species throughout its native range since the late 1960s. Restoration strategies have not been widely adopted in the southern part of the species' range, in part due to lack of information on disease and stand dynamics in the region. We initiated a study in 2004 to determine the feasibility of using butternut in tree ring analysis and to determine effects of climate and competition on growth and mortality of butternut trees. We studied the tree ring characteristics and population dynamics of butternut populations in southwestern Virginia and in central Tennessee. Butternuts in both populations were found to be relatively sensitive to annual variation of climate, particularly Palmer Drought Severity Indices, and had easily distinguishable tree ring boundaries. Overstory tree competition appeared to be accelerating butternut decline in a stand originating from a clearcut, while old-field succession was benefiting a butternut population in another stand. Our results indicate that potential exists to use dendrochronology as a tool in understanding the dynamics between butternut canker disease, exogenous factors (climate, disturbance), and endogenous factors (tree age, genetics) that will affect butternut population restoration efforts. These results should be tested in other parts of the species' range. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This publication synthesizes current information on the biology, distribution, and management of white pine blister rust (WPBR) in the Rocky Mountain Region. In this Region, WPBR occurs within the range of Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata), limber pine (P. flexilis), and whitebark pine (P. albicaulis). This disease threatens white pine species and ecosystems in some of our most treasured public and private lands, including the wildland-urban interface, Wilderness Areas, and National Parks such as Rocky Mountain National Park and Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. Long-term management strategies and management options for sustaining ecosystems and preserving high-value trees are presented. This information provides forest managers with knowledge and resources needed to detect WPBR, evaluate impacted stands, and develop management strategies that are applicable in the Rocky Mountain Region.

AB  - Exotic diseases have fundamentally altered the structure and function of forest ecosystems. Controlling exotic diseases across large expanses of forest has proven difficult, but fire may reduce the levels of diseases that are sensitive to environmental conditions. We examined Cornus florida populations in burned and unburned Quercus-Carya stands to determine if burning prior to anthracnose infection has reduced the impacts of an exotic fungal disease, dogwood anthracnose, caused by Discula destructiva. We hypothesized that fire has altered stand structure and created open conditions less conducive to dogwood anthracnose. We compared C. florida density, C. florida health, and species composition and density among four sampling categories: unburned stands, and stands that had burned once, twice, and 3 times over a 20-year period (late 1960s to late 1980s). Double burn stands contained the greatest density of C. florida stems (770 stems ha-1) followed by triple burn stands (233 stems ha-1), single burn stands (225 stems ha-1) and unburned stands (70 stems ha-1; P &lt; 0.01). We observed less crown dieback in small C. florida trees (&lt;5 cm diameter at breast height) in burned stands than in unburned stands (P &lt; 0.05). Indicator species analysis showed that burning favored species historically associated with Quercus-Carya forests and excluded species associated with secondary succession following nearly a century of fire suppression. Our results suggest that fire may mitigate the decline of C. florida populations under attack by an exotic pathogen by altering forest structure and composition. Further, our results suggest that the burns we sampled have had an overall restorative effect on forest communities and were within the fire return interval of the historic fire regime. Consequently, prescribed fire may offer a management tool to reduce the impacts of fungal disease in forest ecosystems that developed under historic burning regimes. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The worldwide decline in amphibians has been attributed to several causes, especially habitat loss and disease. We identified a further factor, namely "habitat split" - defined as human-induced disconnection between habitats used by different life history stages of a species - which forces forest-associated amphibians with aquatic larvae to make risky breeding migrations between suitable aquatic and terrestrial habitats. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we found that habitat split negatively affects the richness of species with aquatic larvae but not the richness of species with terrestrial development (the latter can complete their life cycle inside forest remnants). This mechanism helps to explain why species with aquatic larvae have the highest incidence of population decline. These findings reinforce the need for the conservation and restoration of riparian vegetation.

AB  - The overstory of the jarrah forest is dominated by Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) with a smaller proportion of Marri (Corymbia calophylla). There are also several smaller tree species in the areas where Alcoa mines. Alcoa's restoration aims to restore all these species at densities similar to the unmined forest. This paper describes the establishment, survival, and growth of these trees with particular focus on Jarrah. Factors affecting the growth and form of Jarrah are also discussed. Establishment of Jarrah from seed in restored sites is variable (mean 10%), and once established, survival is high over two summer droughts (96%) and still high (mean 83%) after about a decade regardless of the presence of the Jarrah dieback disease Phytophthora cinnamomi. High establishment densities (10,000 stems/ha) show mortality rates of 22% after a decade. Growth rates of Jarrah trees are high (1.5-2.7 m2·ha-1·yr-1 basal area), similar to tree growth in unmined forest following clear-fell operations. Jarrah responds to both N and P fertilizers when very young but the response to early N application is not significant after approximately one decade. Between one- and two-thirds of Jarrahs established from seed grow into saplings, but this proportion decreases with increasing tree density. Closer tree spacing results in more single-stemmed Jarrah trees at the expense of growth. Tree seed used for restoration should be sourced from northern Jarrah forest areas with similar soil type and rainfall. Seed from outlier populations and coastal plain vegetation types should not be used. © 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - The challenge for Alcoa's mining operation is simply stated but not so simple to implement; to be able to extract bauxite in large open-cut mine pits without spreading the soil-borne pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. The mining operation clears about 550 ha of Jarrah forest a year and moves about 6 million m3 of soil. Phytophthora cinnamomi has a scattered distribution in the Jarrah forest that results in most mine pits having infested and uninfested portions. Also, there are generally large areas of uninfested forest adjacent to mine pits. Consequently, the potential to spread the pathogen into uninfested forest is very high. This paper describes the development of protocols to prevent spread of P. cinnamomi during mining and restoration, and tools used to assess the success of the program. Monitoring 169 km of the perimeter of mine pits for the introduction of the pathogen to uninfested forest showed very low levels of spread; 0.0006 ha for every hectare mined. The potential for further spread from the new infestation was also estimated by calculating the area of uninfested forest directly downslope from the infestation; this level of spread was 0.002 ha for every hectare mined. We believe that the findings of this study go beyond the issue of disease management during mining. We believe that it is an example of the mining industry recognizing a large threat to the environment and, through a systematic and committed approach, dramatically decreasing the size of the threat to achieve a successful outcome. © 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - Alcoa World Alumina Australia mines bauxite under lease agreements with the Government of Western Australia. The leases lie in the Darling Range to the east of Perth, the capital and major population center. In addition to bauxite and other mineral ores, the Darling Range is a major potable water source and harbors a species-rich forest dominated by Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), a significant commercial timber. Conservation and recreation are important land uses in the region. Social and political pressures have led to stringent governmental requirements for restoration. In addition, a summer drought period, a soil eficient in most nutrients, water management challenges, an introduced disease, caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands, and a post-mining ecosystem that must be conducive to the prescribed burning management of the region pose significant challenges to successful restoration. Alcoa presently mines and restores approximately 550 ha per annum. Although the "footprint" at the end of the life of the mining operations represents only about 4% of the total forest estate, Alcoa is committed to restoring the forest values of the region of all lands impacted by mining. The major objective of restoration is to enhance or maintain forest values by restoring habitat and structural characteristics of the native forest environment. Completion criteria for Alcoa's mine restoration have been developed. The original Alcoa mine at Jarrahdale has been rehabilitated, and in 2005, a 975-ha area received a "certificate of completion" and was returned to the management control of the State of Western Australia. © 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - The American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was historically one of the most important trees in forests of the eastern U.S., but it was severely decimated by chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica). Efforts are underway by The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) and other organizations to develop blight-resistant chestnut trees for restoration. To ensure local adaptability, a variety of American chestnut trees with a broad genetic base is required in the breeding programs, but finding rare flowering American chestnut trees to incorporate into these breeding programs is often difficult. In this study, we used ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) to determine the site affinities of surviving American chestnut trees and to produce a chestnut habitat suitability map for Mammoth Cave National Park (MCNP). Chestnut sprouts were found to be strongly associated with geological formation, slope steepness, elevation, and topographic position. Chestnuts were nearly absent on previously cultivated or pastured lands. The model provides information for efficiently locating chestnut trees, which could be used in breeding programs, and identifying potential restoration sites within the park and in other areas with similar site conditions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 was the most severe in the history of the nuclear industry, causing a huge release of radionuclides over large areas of Europe. The recently completed Chernobyl Forum concluded that after a number of years, along with reduction of radiation levels and accumulation of humanitarian consequences, severe social and economic depression of the affected regions and associated psychological problems of the general public and the workers had become the most significant problem to be addressed by the authorities. The majority of the >600,000 emergency and recovery operation workers and five million residents of the contaminated areas in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine received relatively minor radiation doses which are comparable with the natural background levels. An exception is a cohort of several hundred emergency workers who received high radiation doses and of whom 28 persons died in 1986 due to acute radiation sickness. Apart from the dramatic increase in thyroid cancer incidence among those exposed to radioiodine at a young age and some increase of leukemia in the most exposed workers, there is no clearly demonstrated increase in the somatic diseases due to radiation. There was, however, an increase in psychological problems among the affected population, compounded by the social disruption that followed the break-up of the Soviet Union. Despite the unprecedented scale of the Chernobyl accident, its consequences on the health of people are far less severe than those of the atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Studying the consequences of the Chernobyl accident has made an invaluable scientific contribution to the development of nuclear safety, radioecology, radiation medicine and protection, and also the social sciences. The Chernobyl accident initiated the global nuclear and radiation safety regime. ©2007 Health Physics Society.

AB  - Pre-settlement coniferous forests of southern Utah were influenced by various disturbance regimes, including fire, insects, diseases, and herbivory, which maintained a heterogeneous landscape structure consisting of a diversity of successional stages and vegetative types. The combined effects of fire suppression, logging, and grazing have altered the extent, location, and structure of these forests. Identifying pre-settlement disturbance regimes and forest structures can serve as a reference to return the landscape to a more ecological sustainable system. It is imperative that managers understand that each forest type in southern Utah has coevolved under different disturbance regimes that shaped their structure and community dynamics. Subsequently, hazardous fuel reduction and restoration treatments should differ for each coniferous forest type. Treatment area prioritization should focus on the ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests types where fire regimes and vegetation attributes have been significantly altered from their historical range of variability. These areas will require moderate to high levels of mechanical restoration treatments before fire can be reintroduced to restore the historical fire regime. In contrast, fire regimes in spruce-fir forests have not been drastically altered from their historical range of variability and the risk of losing key ecological components is low to moderate. Therefore, hazardous fuel reduction and restoration treatments in the spruce-fir forests should be of low priority. In ponderosa pine forests, treatments should focus on converting to uneven-aged management, reducing or removing shade tolerant conifers and oak, and reintroducing frequent prescribed surface fires. Mixed conifer forest treatments should focus on reducing the amount of shade tolerant species and leaving more fire-resistant tree species such as ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. Mixed conifer forests should maintain a diversity of vegetation successional stages and age classes juxtaposed to each other. Reintroduction of prescribed fire should not be limited to under-burning since historical fire regimes included some crown fire in mixed conifer ecosystems. Spruce-fir forest treatments should focus on maintaining a landscape of different age structures, successional stages, and fuel breaks to lessenthe risk of entire landscapes burning in one event. Fire suppression in spruce-fir forests should be tempered to allow some forests to burn. To establish and continue a realistic restoration strategy, we must maintain the fire disturbance cycle, whether with prescribed burning or wildfire. The end result of any treatment is to create a heterogeneous landscape structure consisting of a diversity of successional stages and vegetative types that if subjected to wildfire, would retain key ecosystem components.

AB  - With a total area of 8900 km 2, Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles. It is divided in three physiographic regions or areas of relief: the mountainous interior, the karst region, and the coastal plains and valleys. The island comprises six ecological life zones: subtropical dry forest, subtropical moist forest, subtropical wet forest, subtropical rain forest, lower montane wet forest and lower montane rain forest. The herpetofauna of Puerto Rico consists of 25 species of amphibians (19 native, six introduced) and 56 species of reptiles (52 native, four introduced). The goal of this paper is to describe some of the present studies directed towards the conservation of Puerto Rican herpetofauna. Eleutherodactylus karlschmidti, E. jasperi and E. eneidae have not been seen or heard since 1976, 1981 and 1990, respectively, and are probably extinct. Since 2000, the potential causes of amphibian declines in Puerto Rico have been studied, and a synergistic interaction between climate change (increased dry periods) and disease (chytridiomycosis) have been proposed as an explanation for the patterns observed. Recovery efforts for Peltophryne lemur include a captive-breeding program, reintroductions island-wide educational outreach, protection and restoration of existing habitat, and the creation of new breeding ponds. Among reptiles, the first conservation efforts to protect Epicrates inornatus were limited to trying to halt collection and hunting. However, current strategies to preserve the boa include gathering basic biological information, habitat conservation, and educational outreach. Recent efforts for the conservation of Trachemys s. stejnegeri combine three research approaches to clarify the status of local populations: a mark-recapture-release study, field monitoring of reproductive activity (i. e., nocturnal patrolling to identify nesting activity), and field assessment of the potential impact of introduced species, particularly identification of predatory species and exotic turtles. Recovery initiatives for Cyclura stejnegeri include management of invasive mammals, a headstart program for hatchling iguanas, and the assessment of the etiology of a condition causing blindness in adult iguanas. A reforestation project aimed at recovering a local herpetofaunal assemblage after disturbances in a limestone valley in northern Puerto Rico is discussed. As population sizes of common colonizers such as Eleutherodactylus and Anolis increased, larger forest-interior and predatory species like Epicrates inornatus, Alsophis portoricensis and Anolis cuvieri followed. Finally, the Mona Island marine turtle monitoring program is discussed and compared to other similar programs in Puerto Rico. As these and other similar conservation efforts provide scientifically based management recommendations, we hope to succeed in conserving the diverse herpetofauna that characterizes Puerto Rico. © 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.

AB  - The original pasture ecosystems of southern inland Queensland ranged from treeless grasslands on cracking clays through grassy woodlands of varying density on a great range of soil types to those competing at the dynamic edges of forests and scrubs. Fire, both wild and aboriginal-managed, was a major factor, along with rainfall extremes, in shaping the pastures and tree:grass balance. Seedling recruitment was driven by rainfall extremes, availability of germinable seed and growing space, with seed availability and space being linked to the timing and intensity of recent fires and rain. The impact of insects, diseases, severe wind and hailstorms on recruitment should not be underestimated. The more fertile soils had denser grass growth, greater fire frequency and thinner tree cover than infertile soils, except where trees were so dense that grass growth was almost eliminated. The pastures were dominated by perennial tussock grasses of mid-height but included a wide array of minor herbaceous species whose abundance was linked to soil type and recent seasonal conditions. Many were strongly perennial with Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Cyperaceae and Goodeniaceae most common in an environment, which can experience effective rainfall at any time of year. The former grassland communities that are now productive farming lands are not easily returned to their original composition. However, conservation of remnant examples of original pasture types is very achievable provided tree density is controlled, prescribed burning and grazing are used and rigorous control of invasive, exotic species is undertaken. This should be done with a clear understanding that significant short-and medium-term fluctuations in botanical composition are normal.

AB  - Restoration attempts to reintroduce American chestnut trees to the eastern deciduous forest by means of a disease-resistant Chinese-American hybrid seed are in progress. Knowing the light conditions required for optimum seedling performance is necessary to maximize the success of reintroduction. American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) seedlings were planted in two replicate forests in Vinton County, Ohio, in areas that had been thinned (more available light) and in control areas (intact canopy, less available light). The photosynthetic capacity of 12 seedlings per treatment was assessed using an infrared gas-exchange analyzer. Seedlings in the thinned treatment reached light-saturating rates of photosynthesis at an irradiance level approximately 33% higher than did the seedlings in the control treatment. Seedlings grown in the thinned treatment had a significantly greater maximum rate of photosynthesis (Amax), dark respiration rate (Rd), and daily carbon gain per seedling than seedlings grown in the control treatment. The light compensation point (LCP), quantum efficiency (φ), leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf nitrogen concentration per unit leaf area (Narea) were not significantly different between treatments. American chestnut seedlings in the thinned treatment clearly maximize leaf-level photosynthetic capacity. These results will aid land managers in planning reintroduction trials by providing information on the light conditions required for maximum seedling success. © 2007 NRC.

AB  - Savannas are the major biome of tropical regions, spanning 30% of the Earth's land surface. Tree:grass ratios of savannas are inherently unstable and can be shifted easily by changes in fire, grazing, or climate. We synthesize the history and ecological impacts of the rapid expansion and eradication of an exotic large herbivore, the Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalus), on the mesic savannas of Kakadu National Park (KNP), a World Heritage Park located within the Alligator Rivers Region (ARR) of monsoonal north Australia. The study inverts the experience of the Serengeti savannas where grazing herds rapidly declined due to a rinderpest epidemic and then recovered upon disease control. Buffalo entered the ARR by the 1880s, but densities were low until the late 1950s when populations rapidly grew to carrying capacity within a decade. In the 1980s, numbers declined precipitously due to an eradication program. We show evidence that the rapid population expansion and sudden removal of this exotic herbivore created two ecological cascades by altering ground cover abundance and composition, which in turn affected competitive regimes and fuel loads with possible further, long-term effects due to changes in fire regimes. Overall, ecological impacts varied across a north-south gradient in KNP that corresponded to the interacting factors of precipitation, landform, and vegetation type but was also contingent upon the history of buffalo harvest. Floodplains showed the greatest degree of impact during the period of rapid buffalo expansion, but after buffalo removal, they largely reverted to their prior state. Conversely, the woodlands experienced less visible impact during the first cascade. However, in areas of low buffalo harvest and severe impact, there was little recruitment of juvenile trees into the canopy due to the indirect effects of grazing and high frequency of prescribed fires once buffalo were removed. Rain forests were clearly heavily impacted during the first cascade, but the long term consequences of buffalo increase and removal remain unclear. Due to hysteresis effects, the simple removal of an exotic herbivore was not sufficient to return savanna systems to their previous state. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Hardwood forests and plantations are an important economic resource for the forest products industry worldwide and to the international trade of lumber and logs. Hardwood trees are also planted for ecological reasons, for example, wildlife habitat, native woodland restoration, and riparian buffers. The demand for quality hardwood from tree plantations will continue to rise as the worldwide consumption of forest products increases. Tree improvement of temperate hardwoods has lagged behind that of coniferous species and hardwoods of the genera Populus and Eucalyptus. The development of marker systems has become an almost necessary complement to the classical breeding and improvement of hardwood tree populations for superior growth, form, and timber characteristics. Molecular markers are especially valuable for determining the reproductive biology and population structure of natural forests and plantations, and the identity of genes affecting quantitative traits. Clonal reproduction of commercially important hardwood tree species provides improved planting stock for use in progeny testing and production forestry. Development of in vitro and conventional vegetative propagation methods allows mass production of clones of mature, elite genotypes or genetically improved genotypes. Genetic modification of hardwood tree species could potentially produce trees with herbicide tolerance, disease and pest resistance, improved wood quality, and reproductive manipulations for commercial plantations. This review concentrates on recent advances in conventional breeding and selection, molecular marker application, in vitro culture, and genetic transformation, and discusses the future challenges and opportunities for valuable temperate (or "fine") hardwood tree improvement. © 2007 The Society for In Vitro Biology.

AB  - Backcross breeding has provided a viable means to restore American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) to eastern North American forests, where the foundation species was essentially extirpated by an introduced pathogen. With the prospect of American chestnut reintroduction imminent, it is critical to formulate restoration strategies based on the ecology and silvics of the species, operational confines, social or policy limitations, and ecological implications. American chestnut was apparently adapted to a relatively wide range of site conditions, has evolved a capacity to survive for prolonged periods beneath forest canopies yet respond rapidly to disturbance, and demonstrates extraordinary growth and competitive ability. These characteristics are discussed in reference to operative planting techniques and potential for migration of regeneration from hybrid chestnut plantings into forests of the original American chestnut range. The use of hybrid trees for American chestnut reintroduction may generate social and policy ambiguities that require conciliation. Additionally, potential long-term ecological implications associated with reintroduction of American chestnut to the original species range, or introduction to areas outside its original range, must be realized and integrated into reintroduction strategies. Limitations in genetic fitness, potential for disease mutation, and threats from other exotic insects and pathogens may serve as continual challenges to American chestnut restoration. This paper helps establish preliminary guidelines for restoration plantings and creates awareness of imposing ecological issues and barriers that must be overcome to successfully restore American chestnut to its natural range, while simultaneously maintaining ecological integrity and ensuring conservation benefits to eastern North American forests. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We have studied the ecology and conservation requirements of Banksia species in the species-rich sandplains of south-western Australia for 25 years. Loss of habitat through land-clearing has had the greatest impact on their conservation status over the last 50 years. Ascertaining optimal conditions for conservation management in bushland requires detailed knowledge of the species under consideration, including demographic attributes, fire regime, growing conditions and interactions with other species. Where populations have been fragmented, seed production per plant has also fallen. The group most vulnerable to the vagaries of fire, disease, pests, weeds and climate change are the non-sprouters, rather than the resprouters, with population extinction so far confined to non-sprouting species. Recent short-interval fires (<8 years) appear to have had little impact at the landscape scale, possibly because they are rare and patchy. Fire intervals exceeding 25-50 years can also lead to local extinction. Up to 200 viable seeds are required for parent replacement in Banksia hookeriana when growing conditions are poor (low post-fire rainfall, commercial flower harvesting) and seed banks of this size can take up to 12 years to be reached. Seed production is rarely limited by pollinators, but interannual seasonal effects and resource availability are important. Genetic diversity of the seed store is quickly restored to the level of the parents in B. hookeriana. Florivores and granivores generally reduce seed stores, although this varies markedly among species. In Banksia tricuspis, black cockatoos actually increase seed set by selectively destroying borers. Potential loss of populations through the root pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi also challenges management, especially in the southern sandplains. Prefire dead plants are a poor source of seeds for the next generation when fire does occur. Harvesting seeds and sowing post-fire have much to commend them for critically endangered species. Bare areas caused by humans can result in ideal conditions for plant growth and seed set. However, in the case of B. hookeriana/B. prionotes, disturbance by humans has fostered hybridisation, threatening the genetic integrity of both species, whereas fine-textured soils are unsuitable for colonisation or rehabilitation. Few viable seeds become seedlings after fire, owing to post-release granivory and herbivory and unsuitable germination conditions. Seedling-competitive effects ensure that season/intensity of fire is not critical to recruitment levels, except in the presence of weeds. Water availability during summer-autumn is critical and poses a problem for conservation management if the trend for declining rainfall in the region continues. Our simulation modelling for three banksias shows that the probability of co-occurrence is maximal when fire is stochastic around a mean of 13 years, and where fire-proneness and post-fire recruitment success vary in the landscape. Modelling results suggest that non-sprouting banksias could not survive the pre-European frequent-fire scenario suggested by the new grasstree technique for south-western Australia. However, we have yet to fully explore the conservation significance of long-distance dispersal of seeds, recently shown to exceed 2.5 km in B. hookeriana. © CSIRO 2007.

AB  - The three major components of forest biotechnology addressed in this paper are asexual propagation, genomics and genetic engineering (GE). Forest biotechnology offers potential that cannot be realized from conventional breeding because of the long life of forest trees and because of the long time required to make genetic gains through tree improvement programs. Most of the biotechnology research in forest trees has concentrated on genetically variable traits that give a relative quick return on investment: growth, form, insect, disease and herbicide resistance, and wood properties. In the long run, other modified traits should have greater value than is obtained solely from timber management. At the tree or forest level, some of those traits will address carbon sequestration, bioenergy, bioremediation, biopulping and species restoration. At the gene level within a tree, the types of potential gains will include pharmaceuticals, resins, latexes, oils, flavonoids, and foodstuff, inclusive of increased fruit quantity and quality and the sugars and starches embedded in the cell walls. With the advent of nanotechnology, trees of the future will be dissected to form every wood product that is now commercially available and, in addition, a multitude of new products will appear. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Some of the first applications of transgenic trees in North America may be for the conservation or restoration of threatened forest trees that have been devastated by fungal pathogens or insect pests. In some cases, where resistance has yet to be found in the natural population of a tree species, incorporating genes from other organisms may offer the only hope for restoration. In others, transgenics may play a role as part of an integrated approach, along with conventional breeding or biocontrol agents. American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was wiped out as a canopy species by a fungal disease accidentally introduced into the United States around 1900. Similarly, American elm (Ulmus americana) virtually disappeared as a favored street tree from Northeastern U.S. cities after the introduction of the Dutch elm disease fungus in the 1940s. In both cases, progress has been made toward restoration via conventional techniques such as selection and propagation of tolerant cultivars (American elm) or breeding with a related resistant species (American chestnut). Recently, progress has also been made with development of systems for engineering antifungal candidate genes into these "heritage trees." An Agrobacterium-leaf disk system has been used to produce transgenic American elm trees engineered with an antimicrobial peptide gene that may enhance resistance to Dutch elm disease. Two gene transfer systems have been developed for American chestnut using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of embryogenic cultures, setting the stage for the first tests of potential antifungal genes for their ability to confer resistance to the chestnut blight fungus. Despite the promise of transgenic approaches for restoration of these heritage trees, a number of technical, environmental, economic, and ethical questions remain to be addressed before such trees can be deployed, and the debate around these questions may be quite different from that associated with transgenic trees developed for other purposes. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Disturbances that kill trees in forests often co-occur in time and/or space. This process results in changes in the fuel loading for wildfire. Determining specific causes of changing fuel loads can be complex. Path analysis was used to estimate the relative importance and the strength of interaction of each of nine small-scale disturbances affecting forest stands in the Black Hills. Different disturbances were partitioned according to their indirect and direct effects on fuel loads. Fire and wind had the greatest indirect effects; stem rots had the smallest. Root rots had the largest direct effects. Root rots, strong wind, stem rots, suppression, human disturbances, and tree cutting all caused fuel loads to increase. Treeless meadows, stem cankers, fire, ice/snow damage, failed regeneration, and shallow soil were associated with decreasing fuel loads. Grazing, lightning, bark beetles, and competition had null impacts. Disease control has two aims: reducing fire hazard and enhancing restoration. Understanding the biology and ecology of the agents that create dead wood is as fundamental to restoration ecology as it is to forest pathology. Management and control both begin by first determining the cause.

AB  - We determined prevalence and altitudinal distribution of introduced avian malarial infections (Plasmodium relictum) and pox-like lesions (Avipoxvirus) in forest birds from Kipahulu Valley, Haleakalā National Park, on the island of Maui, and we identified primary larval habitat for the mosquito vector of this disease. This intensively managed wilderness area and scientific reserve is one of the most pristine areas of native forest remaining in the state of Hawai'i, and it will become increasingly important as a site for restoration and recovery of endangered forest birds. Overall prevalence of malarial infections in the valley was 8% (11/133) in native species and 4% (4/ 101) in nonnative passerines; prevalence was lower than reported for comparable elevations and habitats elsewhere in the state. Infections occurred primarily in 'Apapane (Himatione sanguinea) and Hawai'i 'Amakihi (Hemignathus virens) at elevations below 1,400 m. Pox-like lesions were detected in only two Hawai'i 'Amaldhi (2%; 2/94) at elevations below 950 m. We did not detect malaria or pox in birds caught at 1,400 m in upper reaches of the valley. Adult mosquitoes (Culex quinquefasciatus) were captured at four sites at elevations of 640,760,915,andm, respectively. Culex quinquefasciatus larvae were found only in rock holes along intermittent tributaries of the two largest streams in the valley, but not in standing surface water, pig wallows, round pools, tree cavities, and tree fern cavities. Mosquito populations in the valllow, an they are probably influenced by periods of high rainfall that flush stream systems. © Wildlife Disease Association 2007.

AB  - The National Tree Seed Centre has been providing seed of known origin and quality for research for 40 years. Seed is also stored for long-term gene conservation purposes to provide a source of germplasm for future research and restoration. This is particularly important for species facing such threats as insect attack, disease, climate change, or conversion of forest land to non-forest uses. The Centre's inventory focuses on native tree and shrub species, striving to store samples from throughout their ranges. Over 26 000 seed samples have been sent to researchers in 65 countries, 70% of these samples being distributed within Canada. Seed research has always been a component of the Seed Centre's program. One notable accomplishment is the development of the Petawawa Germination Box. The Seed Centre participates in and contributes to activities of the Association of Official Seed Analysts, the International Seed Testing Association, and the IUFRO Seed Physiology and Technology Research Group.

AB  - Guidelines were developed by the New Brunswick Forest Gene Conservation Working Group for conserving genetic resources of four native tree species in New Brunswick. Gene conservation guidelines for three of these species aim to maintain sufficient gene pools of known or putatively resistant stock to retain or develop the potential for restoration. Natural populations of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) are known to have genotypes resistant to the beech scale at low frequencies. Gene conservation approaches include in situ and ex situ measures, including resistance breeding. White elm (Ulmus americana) demonstrates a degree of resistance to Dutch elm disease (DED), and will benefit from a mixture of in situ and ex situ conservation measures. Resistance to butternut canker has not yet been demonstrated in populations of butternut (Juglans cinerea), but ex situ conservation of putatively resistant genotypes will be of increasing importance as the frequency of butternut canker escalates. Bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), threatened by small population size, habitat loss, and ongoing development, requires primarily in situ conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.), a common long-lived tree of high elevation and timberline forests in much of western North America, is declining because of insect infestation, fire exclusion, and the introduced white pine blister rust disease. Restoration treatments relying on nursery production of seedlings for artificial regeneration are quickly developing. Cone collecting techniques are a critical step in this process. The aim of this study was to describe common and emerging techniques for cone collection used at Crater Lake National Park in 2005. Recommendations are offered to guide managers and fieldworkers in efficient, safe, and effective cone collection. Copyright © 2007 by the Society of American Foresters.

AB  - Purpose: The clinical question this systematic review aimed to answer was "What are the differences in outcomes of restored endodontically treated teeth compared to implant-supported restorations? Therefore the aim of this study was to use systematic review to compare the survival of compromised teeth restored with either root canal therapy followed by a crown, or placement of a single-tooth implant. Materials and Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched for studies dealing with survival of single-tooth implants and restored endodontically treated teeth. A 2-step screening procedure was used to identify articles that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Fifty-five studies related to single-tooth implants and 13 studies related to restored root canal-treated teeth were included. The endpoint analyzed in these studies was the survival rate of the treated tooth or implant. Results: The 95% confidence intervals for the pooled estimates for the single-tooth implants and restored endodontically treated teeth were found overlapping in forest plots for all follow-up periods. This indicated no significant differences in survival between restored root canal-treated teeth and single-tooth implants. Conclusions: The results of this systematic review indicate that the decision to treat a tooth endodontically or replace it with an implant must be based on factors other than the treatment outcomes of the procedures themselves. Both nonsurgical root canal therapy followed by an appropriate restoration and single-tooth implants are excellent treatment modalities for the treatment of compromised teeth. © 2007 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.

AB  - The devastating forest fires and catastrophic outbreaks of both native and introduced forest insect and disease pests, witnessed in recent times throughout North America, are in part a consequence of forest management practices of the last century. The frequency and intensity of these fires and pest outbreaks exceed all historical records and many view a deteriorated state of the forest environment as a primary cause for those problems. To address this issue President George W. Bush in 2002 launched the Healthy Forest Initiative (HFI). Subsequently the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (HFRA) became law and thereby provided a new emphasis to forest management in the US. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

AB  - A large tree-breeding program has begun in Oregon to improve resistance of Port-Orford-cedar to Phytophthora lateralis, a deadly root disease. To assist in range-wide seed-transfer decisions, five long-term common-garden tests were established with 343 open-pollinated families from 82 native stands. Seven-year height, survival, and health at three field tests showed strong geographic-altitudinal structure. Natural watersheds and derived breeding zones accounted for the majority of genetic variation. Variation was negligible among stands. However, genotype environment interaction was large among families, implying the need to restrict movement or deploy multiple resistant families. Climatic influences from the ocean and altitude of seed origin primarily determined the geographic variation pattern. Survival and growth displayed opposite geographic patterns; coastal sources had highest growth and lowest survival potentials, while interior and higher altitude sources had higher survival and lower growth. Source differences were expressed most at the coastal test site and least at the interior site. Canonical correlation, discriminant, and transfer-risk analyses indicated that initial breeding zones were too conservative and five provisional zones describe major adaptive differences. Subdivision of breeding for restoring serpentine soil ecotypes was also examined. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forest ecosystem restoration is a growing emphasis in the southwestern United States to address over 120 years of forest structure change, decreased forest health, and increased potential for disease and wildfire. Restoration treatments replicating pre-settlement conditions may reduce tree density by 98%, are detrimental to canopy-dependent wildlife such as tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti), particularly at the patch scale, and are of concern when applied at the landscape scale. We examined S. aberti population dynamics in north-central Arizona, U.S.A., from 1999 to 2002 at nine 280-ha sites oriented along a landscape gradient of varying proportions (4.6-99.2%) of unlogged, high-quality (HQ) habitats within a matrix of intensively thinned low-quality habitat. Our objectives were to estimate S. aberti density, juvenile recruitment, and survival across this gradient; quantify patch- and landscape-scale habitat relationships to populations; evaluate possible habitat thresholds in squirrel population response; and develop forest management recommendations. In regression models, both patch-scale and landscape-scale parameters influenced squirrel populations. At the patch scale, number of interlocking canopy trees was added most frequently, whereas the proportion of HQ habitat was the landscape-scale variable added in five of seven models. Recruitment and survival at dense, HQ plots were inversely related to number of small, sapling-sized trees. Nonlinear thresholds in density and recruitment occurred when the proportion of HQ habitat at study sites was between 24 and 42%. Our study points to the importance of maintaining HQ habitat in mesoreserves on the landscape at or above this threshold range, as well as pursing a mix of forest management prescriptions in the matrix surrounding mesoreserves to achieve wildlife, forest restoration, and fire risk reduction objectives. © 2006 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - Conservation of genetic diversity of our forest species represents the foundation of a sustainable forest management and preservation of natural structure of our forest stands, currently making 95% of the total woodland area. Croatia's richness diversity of geographical regions has resulted in various ecological types and a large number of forest trees that are directly affected by habitat degradation, different types of soil, air and water pollution, excessive use of some more valuable species of forest trees, increasing impact of global climatic changes, as well as by anthropogenic effects. The need for conservation of genetic variability is related to the species pertaining to social broadleaves - the prevailing species in terms of our economic utilization (pedunculate oak, sessile oak, and common beech). Among the conifers, silver fir (Abies alba) is the most endangered species, with more than 70% of its population being permanently damaged. Other native coniferous species must be preserved from a decrease in genetic variability as well. Conservation of noble broadleaves should encompass a larger number of species from various genus (Fraxinus, Alnus, Ulmus, Prunus, Juglans, Castanea, Sorbus, Acer, Malus, Pyrus, Tilia). These are partially endangered because of their exposure to different diseases and pests, as well as by continuous exploration caused by their technical value. Changes in hydrological conditions of our rivers have generated difficulties in restoration of riparian forests, and decreased genetic variability of European black and white poplar in their habitats. In coastal areas of our country, there is a need for conservation of genetic resources of Dalmatian black pine (P. nigra ssp. dalmatica) and our Mediterannean oaks. Conservation of genetic diversity of various species of forest trees is conducted within the programmes that include in situ dynamic methods and ex situ static methods. In Croatia, a total of 303 seed stands and selected seed stands have been selected, covering a total area of 17 612 ha. The ex situ method was used to establish a total of 50 plots (clonal seed orchards, provenances and progeny trials, clonal archives), covering 114,85 ha. Conservation of genes in forest trees represents maintenance of the evolution created adaptation potential of a particular species, i.e. its forest community and the entire forest ecosystem. For the purpose of conservation of forest genetic resources, we must protect the existing genetic variability, its adaptability to processes of natural evolution and forest tree breeding, as well as improve our knowledge and ways of identification of those individuals that have developed tolerance to certain diseases and pests. That way, we will be able to prevent a decrease in genetic resources of the endangered species. The research is to be supplemented with data including making of species inventories, legislation, practical use, coordination on national and paneuropean levels, together with promotion of public awareness on the importance of conservation of the endangered species in forest ecosystems.

AB  - 1 This account reviews information on all aspects of the biology of bracken Pteridium (mainly aquilinum ssp. aquilinum) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2 Pteridium is a complex genus comprising a number of species, subspecies and varieties. The treatment here is based on a recent revision that incorporates both morphological and molecular data, and is related to its geographical distribution. 3 Pteridium is thought to be a woodland genus, but it can grow in the open. It is cosmopolitan and occurs on all continents except Antarctica. It responds to human disturbance and is often found in open spaces after forest clearance and cultivation. In some situations it can be a troublesome weed, causing problems for land managers. Moreover, its abundance and distribution in Britain are predicted to increase as a result of global climate change. 4 Pteridium aquilinum ssp. aquilinum, the most common taxon in the British Isles, occurs in many plant communities, and it is apparently limited by frost and waterlogging. Its abundance has probably increased in the relatively recent past as a result of changing land management, and this increase impinges on plant communities with a high conservation interest. The changed land management reflects changing use of agricultural land and also a reduction in the use of Pteridium as a resource. Accordingly, in many places Pteridium is viewed as a weed and management is needed to control it and restore more desirable vegetation. These management techniques are summarized. © 2006 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To assess the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic surgery for patients with ulcerative colitis. Methods: A search of published studies in English between January 1992 and September 2005 was obtained, using the MEDLINE and PubMed databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Two independent assessors reviewed the studies using a standardized protocol. Where raw data, means and standard deviations were available, meta-analysis was performed using the Forest plot review. Studies where medians and ranges were presented were separately analysed. Results: The duration of surgery for laparoscopic and open procedures were similar (weighted mean difference 62.92 min, P = 0.19). Patients were able to tolerate oral intake significantly earlier, with a weighted mean difference of 1.39days (P = 0.002), but recovery of bowel function was similar (weighted mean difference 0.73 days, P = 0.36). The length of hospital stay was shorter for patients who had undergone laparoscopic surgery, with a weighted mean difference of 2.64 days (P = 0.003). The complication rate was higher in open colectomy, compared to laparoscopic colectomy (67.6% vs 39.7%, P = 0.005). For restorative proctocolectomy, complication rates were comparable between the laparoscopic and open groups (P = 0.25). Conclusions: The time taken to perform laparoscopic surgery is similar to open surgery. Patients are able to tolerate oral intake earlier, and have a shorter hospitalization. Laparoscopic colectomy was safer compared to the open procedure, but both were equally safe for patients who had restorative proctocolectomy. Thus, laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis is both safe and feasible. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - 1 Natural and recurring disturbances caused by fire, native forest insects and pathogens have interacted for millennia to create and maintain forests dominated by seral or pioneering species of conifers in the interior regions of the western United States and Canada. 2 Changes in fire suppression and other factors in the last century have altered the species composition and increased the density of trees in many western forests, leading to concomitant changes in how these three disturbance agents interact. 3 Two- and three-way interactions are reviewed that involve fire, insects and pathogens in these forests, including fire-induced pathogen infection and insect attack, the effects of tree mortality from insects and diseases on fuel accumulation, and efforts to model these interactions. 4 The emerging concern is highlighted regarding how the amount and distribution of bark beetle-caused tree mortality will be affected by large-scale restoration of these fire-adapted forest ecosystems via prescribed fire. 5 The effects of fire on soil insects and pathogens, and on biodiversity of ground-dwelling arthropods, are examined. 6 The effects of fire suppression on forest susceptibility to insects and pathogens, are discussed, as is the use of prescribed fire to control forest pests. © 2006 The Authors.

AB  - One unexpected consequence of natural disturbances in forested areas is that managers often initiate activities that may impose greater ecosystem impacts than the disturbances themselves. By salvage logging areas affected by windstorms or other impacts, by harvesting host trees in advance of insect infestation or disease, or by preemptively harvesting forests In an attempt to improve their resilience to future disturbances and stresses, managers initiate substantial changes in the ecosystem structure and function. Much of this activity is undertaken in the absence of information on the qualitative and quantitative differences between disturbance impacts and harvesting. To provide insight for such decisions we evaluated the ecosystem consequences of two major disturbance processes in New England (U.S.A.) - intense windstorms and invasive pests and pathogens - and contrasted them with impacts from preemptive and salvage harvesting. Despite dramatic physical changes inforest structure resulting from hurricane impacts and insect infestation, little disruption of biogeochemical processes or other ecosystem functions typically follows these disturbances. Indeed, the physical and organic structures produced by these disturbances are important natural features providing habitat and landscape heterogeneity that are often missing due to centuries of land use. From an ecosystem perspective there are strong arguments against preemptive and salvage logging or the attempt through silvicultural means to improve the resistance or resilience of forests to disturbance and stress. There are often valid motivations for salvage or preemptive logging including financial considerations, human safety, and a desire to shape the long-term composition and resource-production characteristics of forests. Nonetheless, there are many ecological benefits derived from leaving forests alone when they are affected or threatened by disturbances and pest and pathogen outbreaks. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - We reviewed the behavior of wildfire in riparian zones, primarily in the western United States, and the potential ecological consequences of postfire logging. Fire behavior in riparian zones is complex, but many aquatic and riparian organisms exhibit a suite of adaptations that allow relatively rapid recovery after fire. Unless constrained by other factors, fish tend to rebound relatively quickly, usually within a decade after a wildfire. Additionally, fire and subsequent erosion events contribute wood and coarse sediment that can create and maintain productive aquatic habitats over time. The potential effects of postfire logging in riparian areas depend on the landscape context and disturbance history of a site; however, available evidence suggests two key management implications: (1) fire in riparian areas creates conditions that may not require intervention to sustain the long-term productivity of the aquatic network and (2) protection of burned riparian areas gives priority to what is left rather than what is removed. Research is needed to determine how postfire logging in riparian areas has affected the spread of invasive species and the vulnerability of upland forests to insect and disease outbreaks and how postfire logging will affect the frequency and behavior of future fires. The effectiveness of using postfire logging to restore desired riparian structure and function is therefore unproven, but such projects are gaining interest with the departure of forest conditions from those that existed prior to timber harvest, fire suppression, and climate change. In the absence of reliable information about the potential consequence of postfire timber harvest, we conclude that providing postfire riparian zones with the same environmental protections they received before they burned is justified ecologically. Without a commitment to monitor management experiments, the effects of postfire riparian logging will remain unknown and highly contentious. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - The benefits from the development of transgenic trees are expected from the improvement of traits as growth and form, wood quality, industrial processes, disease and insect resistance, herbicide tolerance, ecological restoration, rooting ability, etc. One of the first reported field trials with genetically modified forest trees was established in Belgium in 1988 and the characteristic evaluated was herbicide tolerance in poplars. Since then, there have been more than 200 reported trials, involving at least 15 forest species. The majority of the field trials have been carried out in the USA (64%). More than 50% of the field trials are done with Populus species and the main target traits are herbicide tolerance (31%), followed by marker genes (23%) and insect resistance (14%). Until today, there is only one report on commercial-scale production of transgenic forest trees which is Populus nigra with the Bt gene release in China in 2002 and established on commercial plantations in 2003. Operational application of GMO's in forestry depends on technical, economical, political and public aspects, but the development of adequate regulatory frameworks and public acceptance of transgenic trees will define the future of this technology in forestry. © 2006 by Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso.

AB  - Morphological features of leaves and twigs of American chestnut, Chinese chestnut, their F1 hybrid, and three successive generations of backcrosses between hybrid populations and American chestnut were examined to determine rate of recovery of the American chestnut morphology after hybridization to capture Chinese chestnut genes for blight resistance. In aggregate morphology, as measured by a composite index of species identity (ISI), 96% of trees in the third backcross generation (BC3) resembled American chestnut and were distinctly different from Chinese chestnut. The majority of BC3 trees also differed from Chinese chestnut in every individual characteristic measured for this study. Thus, recovery of American chestnut characteristics is largely achieved after three generations of backcrossing. If progeny of the BC3 hybrids can be made homozygous for blight-resistance alleles, as expected, and if the trees equally resemble American chestnut in important ecological attributes, then backcross breeding appears to be a workable strategy for restoring this species as a important component of eastern U.S. forests. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The reintroduction of large mammals is often considered a priority conservation action in highly industrialized countries in which many of these species have been depleted. However, species reintroduction after decades of absence may involve important risks for human activities and ecological communities, such as favoring the spread of diseases. An example of a potentially troublesome reintroduction is the wild boar, which may act as a reservoir of diseases, e.g., classical swine fever, and cause high economic losses, and has become a species of concern in several European countries for both ecological and recreational reasons. Failure to prevent the disease consequences of species restoration can negate its conservation benefits. Here we evaluated the probability of both successfully reintroducing wild boar into Denmark and limiting their contact with domestic pig farms to which they might spread disease. For this purpose, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based population model that incorporates information on boar habitat and demography information from Central European populations. We then compared model predictions with the spatial distribution of farms to achieve a spatial assessment of the contact risk. The most restrictive model scenario predicted that nearly 6% of Denmark provides habitat conditions that would allow wild boar to reproduce. The best habitats for reintroduction were aggregated in seven different areas throughout the country in which the extinction probability was < 5%. However, the expected population expansion was very limited in most of these areas. Both the number of suitable areas and the potential for population expansion greatly increased when we relaxed our habitat assumptions about boar forest requirements; this provided a more conservative scenario for a cautious risk analysis. We additionally found that part of the risk of contact with piggeries was associated with the magnitude of the expansion, although the nonrandom spatial pattern of farm distribution also had a strong influence. The partitioning of risks into those related to population expansion and those related to farm distribution allowed us to identify trade-offs between restoring boar populations and minimizing risks in different potential areas and under different risk scenarios; as a result, we rejected some of the particularly high-risk areas for potential reintroduction of the species. Our approach illustrates how the joint quantification of anticipated reintroduction success and associated risks can guide efforts aimed at reconciling species recovery and the affected health and economic interests.

AB  - Nonnative invasive pathogens have decimated North American forests for over 100 years, and additional pathogens continue to arrive. These pathogens are destined to be permanent fixtures in the ecosystem. In many cases, management activities have been unsuccessful in slowing the spread of these pathogens or in restoring forests. Genetic resistance potentially provides an invaluable management tool for restoring these species or using them in plantations. Although native tree species are highly susceptible to some nonnative pathogens, a low frequency of resistance is present in even those North American host species most affected. Classical breeding methods can produce genetically diverse and resistant populations for reforestation or restoration of natural forests. However, any operational program for developing resistant populations of forest trees must contend with relatively long generation times, as well as the long-lived nature of trees and the potential of the pathogen to evolve. Western white pine (Pinus monticola), Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), American chestnut (Castanea dentata), and American elm (Ulmus americana) are examples of species for which there are successful breeding programs for disease resistance. Examples from these species, with a particular focus on western white pine and white pine blister rust [Cronartium ribicola] resistance, will be used to illustrate some of the successes in operational programs, as well as to discuss some of the research needs and current unknowns in developing durable resistance. Some of these programs have been ongoing for 50 years, while the Port-Orford-cedar program began only in the last decade. Resistant seedlings from several programs are now being used in reforestation and restoration.

AB  - American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) was once an important hardwood species in the forests of eastern North America. Following the chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr) pandemic of the early 20th century, C. dentata remains only as sprouts throughout much of its range. We conducted a dendroecological analysis of a large naturalized stand of mature C. dentata to evaluate the species' growth capacity, ecology, and restoration potential. Eestablishment of C. dentata was sporadic in the first 40 years of our chronology, followed by a disturbance-associated recruitment pulse. The species appears to be tolerant of suppression in the understory, but responded to release with rapid radial growth (&gt;10 mm·year-1). Although its climate-growth relationships are similar to those of other hardwood species, mean radial growth of C. dentata was nearly twice that of other hardwood species found in the stand (4.7 ± 0.21 vs. 2.5 ± 0.16 mm·year-1). Chestnut blight has recently infected this stand, resulting in a sharp depression in the growth chronology of C. dentata, even when outward signs of infection were not yet visible. Observed establishment and growth patterns suggest that blight-resistant C. dentata is likely to attain dominance rapidly in forests where restoration efforts include canopy manipulations that increase light availability. © 2006 NRC.

AB  - Bayesian decision support tools are becoming increasingly popular as a modelling framework that can analyse complex problems, resolve controversies, and support future decision-making in an adaptive management framework. This paper introduces a model designed to assist the management of the endangered Camphora swamp eucalypt (Eucalyptus camphora). This tree species is found in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve (YNCR), an isolated patch of forest in the Yarra Valley (Victoria, Australia). The eucalypt community provides both habitat and food for a variety of threatened and endangered flora and fauna. Over the last 20 years the E. camphora has become increasingly threatened by dieback. In order to maintain and rehabilitate existing trees and encourage regeneration, management strategies and action plans have concentrated on restoring the hydrological regime, which has been altered due to agricultural activities within the catchment. However, research suggests that nutrient enrichment from surrounding horticulture and livestock is having a greater impact on the health of the trees. The Bayesian decision support tool has been used to examine the differences between these two hypotheses. The tool will also promote future integrative and iterative monitoring and research in the YNCR. This project was undertaken as part of a larger piece of work developing risk-based assessment guidelines for natural resource management, a process known as Ecological Risk Assessment. The Woori Yallock Creek Catchment, of which YNCR is a part, was chosen for the case study due to the high ecological assets identified in the catchment, the diverse land use and activities in the region, and the large body of knowledge and data available. The case study aims to identify environmental assets at greatest risk from ecological degradation in the Woori Yallock Creek Catchment and subsequently identify options for managing these risks. Phase One of the risk assessment process is problem formulation. Input was sought from a wide range of interest groups via one-on-one interviews and a workshop. The priority environmental assets in the catchment were subsequently identified, along with the hazards that threatened these assets. The Sedge-rich E. camphora community within YNCR was identified as one of the priority threatened environmental assets within the Woori Yallock Creek Catchment. For the purposes of this case study the condition of E. camphora was identified as the management end point for which YNCR will be managed. Phase Two (risk analysis) utilised Bayesian networks (BN) to quantify the risks to E. camphora. BNs are probabilistic networks that support reasoning under uncertainty. BNs are used to establish causal relationships between key factors and final outcomes, and maintain clarity by making causal assumptions explicit (Stow and Borsuk 2003). They are particularly useful for uncertainty analysis as they have the ability to consider inadequate knowledge or understanding of system processes, inherent randomness, subjective judgment and vagueness in parameter estimation, disagreement, measurement error and sampling error (Morgan and Henrion 1990). Risks to the condition of E. camphora have been prioritised and key knowledge gaps identified, while accounting for predictive uncertainties. Using the networks, the outcomes of a range of management scenarios have also been tested. The parameters that are most influential in determining E. camphora condition according to the model are generally soil nutrients, soil cations, pests or disease and inundation patterns (duration and frequency). The findings show E. camphora responses are different for each region in the model, and findings are specific for each survey. Much of the data used to parameterize the model was patchy and qualitative. This has contributed to significant knowledge gaps. The results of this study should be viewed as a guide to further work.

AB  - In contrast to a few isolated forests in northern Mexico, most forests in the western Untied States have been significantly modified by fire suppression, harvesting, and livestock grazing. This has increased their fire hazards and many are in need of restoration. Understanding reference conditions is challenging because we have few intact forests functioning under the continuing influence of climate variation, insects, diseases, and frequent fires. This article summarizes information from reference sites and argues for incorporating natural heterogeneity in restoration targets across similar forests in the United States.

AB  - The auto toxicity of tree species secretions, regulates the stand structure. The negative effects of one plant species on soil, cultivated in one place for long time and the associated problems have been summarized (11, 12). The soil fatigue is a cyclic phenomena, caused by the unilateral development of soil microflora, allelopathy, accumulation of toxins in the soil, development of pathogenic microorganisms, other pests and weeds changes in soil pH and disturbed soil structure etc. In agriculture, soil fatigue is connected to allelopathy, however, in forestry little data are available. The monoculture of tree stand for long periods slowly intoxicates the soil, leading to the gradual changes in tree species composition. These accumulated toxic substances may be absorbed by other plants and microorganisms, bound to these plants and after some time the former composition of stand could be restored. Based on of current typology, the changes in tree species structure are not considered, as it may be due to site conditions. Therefore, autointoxication (besides other anthropogenic effects) contributes to the weakening of individual tree species, which gradually causes dieback in fir or attack of pests and diseases on elm, spruce and oak. © International Allelopathy Foundation 2005.

AB  - The loss of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) due to the fungal pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica had a considerable effect on the ecology of eastern forests. Because of its historical importance, researchers have worked to develop a blight-resistant variety of American chestnut for establishment into its former range. Chestnut breeders now predict that such varieties will be available within a decade. Information on forest communities in which chestnut was abundant prior to the blight should provide historical legitimacy to restoration efforts and increase the likelihood of success. We analyzed "witness" trees from settlement-era land deeds in order to guide site selection for chestnut restoration at Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky. Chestnut was the ninth most important species in our sample and was positively associated with white oak (Quercus alba) and black oak (Quercus velutina) and negatively associated with post oak (Quercus stellata) and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica). Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated that chestnut was associated with chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), and white oak in the overstory of pre-blight forests, and with serviceberry (Amelanchier arborea) and sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum) in sub-canopy layers. We suggest targeting restoration sites which contain these species and avoiding sites where post oak or blackjack oak are currently dominant. Witness tree analysis allows for the identification of vegetation associations that historically had a chestnut component, increasing the potential for restoration success. Even so, silvicultural considerations and the introductions of pests and pathogens other than the blight fungus may inhibit chestnut restoration.

AB  - The wild grapevine, Vitis vinifera L. subsp. silvestris (Gmelin) Hegi, is considered to be an endangered taxon in Europe, mainly as a consequence of the introduction of pathogens from North America and of the destruction of its habitat. In the Rhine Valley, nearly all populations disappeared due to river management, the intensi.cation of forestry, and the introduction of phylloxera. After a growing awareness of the need to preserve endangered forest ecosystems, attempts to reintroduce wild grapevine in the Rhine Valley were performed, particularly in the French nature reserves Erstein and Offendorf since 1992. However, regular surveys of the plants indicate the rapid decline of the populations. In 2002, we proposed to summarise the knowledge accumulated after 10 years of experiments. Results indicate that from the initial 91 individuals planted in 1992, only 14 survived in 2002 (2 in Erstein, 12 in Offendorf). The failure of the experiment may be explained by several factors: unsuitable sites (too shady, absence of support for the young plants), absence of monitoring, vandalism or predation. According to these results and recent knowledge of the ecology of the plant and of vines in general, new transplantation experiments are proposed in which the plants will be monitored during their establishment in the forests. The success of this second transplant (50 plants per reserve) will be enhanced by restoration projects of the Rhine River dynamics, with partial re-flooding. Floods should help to avoid, or at least to reduce, pest and disease expansion on future adult plants. © Springer 2005.

AB  - We initiated a study of the effects of mycorrhizal fungal community composition on the restoration of tropical dry seasonal forest trees. Tree seedlings were planted in a severely burned experimental site (1995 fire) during the growing season of 1998 at the El Edén Ecological Reserve, in north Quintana Roo, Mexico. Seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia, Caesalpinia violacea, Piscidia piscipula, Gliricidia sepium, and Cochlospermum vitifolium were germinated in steam-sterilized soil and either remained uninoculated (nonmycorrhizal at transplanting) or were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi in soils from early-seral (recently burned) or late-seral (mature forest) inoculum. Inoculum from the early-seral soil was largely Glomus spp., whereas a diverse community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were reintroduced from the mature forest including species of Scutellospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, Sclerocystis, and Acaulospora. Plants grew better when associated with the mature forest inoculum, unlike a previous experiment in which plants grew taller with the early-seral inoculum. Reasons for the different responses include a less-intense burn resulting in more residual organic matter. In addition to mycorrhizal responses, plants were severely affected by deer browsing. One tree species, C. vitifolium found in the region but not in the reserve, was eliminated by a resident fungal facultative pathogen. Several practical conclusions for restoration can be made. The common nursery practice of soil sterilization may be detrimental because it eliminates beneficial mycorrhizal fungi; species not native to the site may not survive because they may not be adapted to the local pathogens; and herbivory can be severe depending on the landscape context of the restoration. © 2005 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - At the turn of the last century, nearly one out of every four trees in the eastern deciduous forests of the United States was an American chestnut. Averaging 30 meters tall and 2 meters wide, these majestic beauties ranged from Maine down through the Appalachian mountains and west to Michigan. The fast-growing and naturally rot-resistant chestnut was an important part of early American life, its timber widely used for log cabins, posts, and railroad ties and its abundant nut crop sustaining wildlife as well as livestock. But within 40 years, a fungal blight had spread throughout the tree's range, felling virtually every chestnut it touchcd-some 3.5 billion in all. Brought in by a New York nurseryman on imported Asian chestnut seedlings that were then sent all over the country, the blight moved stealthily from tree to tree, entering through a break in the bark and producing an acid that lowered the tree's pH to toxic levels. Because it attacks new shoots before they can mature, the fungus has reduced the once dominant chestnut to little more than a short-lived shrub. Ever si nce chestnut blight was first described at the Bronx Zoo in 1904, scientists have been struggling to defeat it. One of several efforts is going on in the labs of Chuck Maynard and Bill Powell, directors of New York State's American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project. The two scientists have been working since the late 1980s to genetically engineer a blight-resistant American chestnut. In the fall of 2004, they made a major breakthrough: shoots finally appeared on a handful of blight-resistant chestnut embryos in petri dishes in Maynard's lab. Each of the tiny embryos had a gene from wheat to give it an extra enzyme, oxalate oxidase, which neutralizes the oxalic acid produced by the blight. It's impossible to know in advance what kind of impacts transgenic trees will have on wild forests. Maynard and Powell see only a minuscule risk of ecological disruption (if any) with their GM chestnut, since it will contain just three or four foreign genes-the target trait plus a few others needed for the desired transformation. The scientists say greater unknowns exist with the conventionally bred and backcrossed American chestnut, which draws one-sixteenth of its genes from its naturally blight-resistant relative, the Chinese chestnut.

AB  - The American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) was once an important tree species in the eastern United States prior to its devastation by the chestnut blight. The American Chestnut Foundation will soon release seeds that are blight resistant. However, the necessary site requirements for restoration efforts have not yet been explored. The goal of this study was to evaluate the survival and growth of chestnut seedlings within a diverse forest management regime. Seedlings were experimentally grown for 2 years in three mixed-oak forests subjected to thinning, burning, thinning followed by burning, and an untreated control. Seedling biomass parameters were most influenced by treatments that increased light availability. Soil chemistry and texture parameters were also correlated (p < 0.05) with chestnut biomass. Thus, site fertility should also be considered in reintroduction efforts. While site quality may influence growth, light conditions appear to be overwhelmingly important. Therefore, we recommend that American chestnut seeds be planted in areas with moderate to high light conditions (recently disturbed), with low surrounding competing vegetation (possibly after a burn) for optimal growth benefits. © 2005 NRC.

AB  - This study reports on three scarlet macaw (Ara macao) reintroduction projects using hand-raised birds in Peru and Costa Rica. The habitats at the release sites ranged from pristine tropical forest to forest fragments in an agricultural matrix. The combined first-year survival was 74% and the annual post first-year survival was 96%. Survival rates were very high despite a wide range in predator communities. Number of birds released explained 70% of the variation in survival with birds from larger releases having higher survival rates. Behavioral evidence suggests that birds established at the site facilitated survival of later releases. Breeding attempts were recorded at all three sites and hand-raised birds with wild mates successfully fledged young in Peru. Supplemental feeding post-release played an important role in keeping the birds near the release site and facilitating social interactions. This work shows that properly socialized hand-raised macaws can survive and breed in the wild but that ex-pets are not good release candidates. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since late July, 2000, fruiting bodies of Rhizina undulata, an ascomycetous fungus which causes root rot on coniferous trees, began to develop after a forest fire in the eastern coastal pine forests of Korea. In a survey conducted in August, they were abundantly developed in the fire-damaged pine forests. The occurrence frequency of the fruiting bodies seemed to be correlated with the degree of damage by the forest fire. That is, in severely damaged or completely burned areas, fruiting bodies were found around trees with abundant frequency, whereas moderate or slightly damaged areas showed a relatively low occurrence frequency. In addition, pine seedlings transplanted just after the fire outbreak were infected and killed by this fungus, producing typical symptoms on the infected roots. These phenomena present a warning that Rhizina root rot may cause severe damage on still-alive pine trees after being burnt in fire-damaged forests. This disease also may attack pine seedlings which are transplanted to restore the symbiotic relationships with the mycelium of pine mushroom, Tricholoma matsutake, just after a forest fire. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduced avian pox virus and malaria have had devastating impacts on native Hawaiian forest birds, yet little has been published about their prevalence and distribution in forest bird communities outside of windward Hawaii Island. We surveyed native and non-native forest birds for these two diseases at three different elevations on leeward Mauna Loa Volcano at the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Prevalence of malaria by both serology and microscopy varied by elevation and ranged from 28% at 710 m to 13% at 1830 m. Prevalence of pox-like lesions also varied by altitude, ranging in native species from 10% at 710 m to 2% at 1830 m. Native species at all elevations had the highest prevalence of malarial antibody and pox-like lesions. By contrast, pox-like lesions were not detected in individuals of four non-native species and only 5% of Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) was positive for malaria. A significantly high proportion of birds with pox-like lesions also had serological evidence of concurrent, chronic malarial infections, suggesting an interaction between these diseases, dual transmission of both diseases by the primary mosquito vector (Culex quinquefasciatus) or complete recovery of some pox-infected birds without loss of toes. Results from this study document high prevalence of malaria and pox at this refuge. Development of effective disease control strategies will be important for restoration of remnant populations of the endangered 'Akiapola'au (Hemignathus munroi), Hawaii Creeper (Oreomystis mana), and Hawaii 'Akepa (Loxops coccineus coccineus) that still occur on the refuge. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2005.

AB  - Traditional fisheries management in southern California has failed, in part because it is based on an assumption of an unvarying environment and is focused on size limits rather than insuring the persistence of aggregations of large fecund individuals. The combined effect of low frequency climatic variability and anthropogenic perturbations can have dramatic consequences for abalone in southern California. Abalone species are tightly linked to kelp forest ecosystems that, besides furnishing habitat, also provide the main food source for abalone. In southern California, kelp canopies are very sensitive to oceanographic climate because the kelp depend upon high nutrients in the water column. Oceanic warming, in turn, results in decreased nutrients in the surface water, and this is correlated with marked reductions in giant kelp biomass. Here we address the additive effects of ocean warming on two species of California abalone (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens; and the green abalone, H. fulgens) by subjecting them to varied environmental conditions similar to cool, normal, and warm phases of the California current in the southern California Bight. Our experimental design simultaneously tested the synergistic effects of temperature and food quantity and quality on survivorship, growth, and reproduction. For red abalone, warm temperatures increased the onset of withering syndrome, a fatal abalone disease, and halted growth and reproduction. In contrast, green abalone survivorship, growth, and reproduction were relatively robust irrespective of temperature, while their growth and reproduction were most strongly influenced by food quantity. We found clear evidence suggesting that, combined with overfishing, California abalone populations are adversely affected by ecosystem responses to ocean warming: Coolwater red abalone suffer stronger consequences in warm water than do green abalone. Conservation, restoration, and recovery plans of remnant California abalone populations must consider these relationships when taking any action. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Although muscle diseases occur relatively rarely in cats, a number of congenital feline myopathies have been described over the last 20 years and are reviewed in this paper. Some of them have been reported exclusively in specific breeds, including the hypokalaemic myopathy of Burmese cats, type IV glycogen storage disease in Norwegian Forest cats, or the myopathy of Devon Rex. Other congenital disorders of muscle and neuromuscular junction such as myotonia congenita, dystrophin-deficient hypertrophic feline muscular dystrophy, laminin α2 deficiency, or congenital myasthenia gravis may occur in any cat. A systematic approach is essential in order to efficiently obtain a timely diagnosis in cats showing signs of muscle disease. After a thorough clinical examination, this approach includes blood analyses (eg, serum concentration of muscle enzymes), electrophysiology where available (electromyography, nerve conduction studies), and sampling of muscle biopsies for histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical evaluation. When available, detection of healthy carriers of these genetic disorders is important to eliminate the gene mutations from breeding families. Clinicians regularly receiving feline patients must have a good knowledge of congenital feline myopathies and the features which enable a diagnosis to be made and prognosis given. Besides preserving or restoring the well-being of the myopathic patient, rapid and efficient information and counselling of the breeders are of central importance in order to prevent the recurrence of the problem in specific breeding lines. © 2004 ESFM and AAFP.

AB  - In 1995 a timber salvage rider passed in a budget bill, signed and endorsed by President Clinton, to block legal challenges to old-growth and salvage logging under existing environmental protection laws. Ostensibly, Republicans introduced the salvage rider to reduce the threat of Wre and restore "health" to forests plagued by disease, particularly in the West. But the rider was also designed to override environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act without due regard to environmental damage from logging practices, which had been severely restricted by federal court since 1990.1 The results were predictable. Timber sales dating as far back as 1989 were Wnalized at a feverish rate. By the spring of 1996, Clinton criticized logging practices under the rider for damaging the watersheds and nesting grounds of such threatened birds as the spotted owl and the marbled murrelet. However, the rider that Clinton signed and endorsed permitted such damage. By objecting to the salvage rider after signing it into law, it appeared that the president was trying to please everyone by talking the environmentalist talk, while walking the timber industry walk, or saving the forest by giving the industry a quick Wx. As a result, the salvage rider and President Clinton's rhetoric surrounding it reignited the longstanding controversy in the PaciWc Northwest over the logging practices in old-growth forests. In this chapter I examine President Clinton's discourse on the salvage rider as a rhetorical strategy that attempted to appease Wrst the timber industry and then the environmentalists during a critical time period leading up to and including his reelection campaign. I argue that Clinton's rhetoric was a strategic response constrained by clashing ironic perspectives held by the timber industry and environmentalists, perspectives with divergent social realities that prevent resolution of this forest conXict. In essence, the timber industry's ironic 7 182 / The Environmental President Who Wasn't perspective grows out of the belief that protecting nature leads to human extinction; by saving the spotted owl or marbled murrelet, loggers must perish. Environmentalists, on the other hand, express irony by claiming that the success that led to the rise of the timber industry will ultimately be the cause of its failure. That is, technological Wxes from a salvage rider only lead to greater destruction. I also argue that these perspectives are not the product of what is known as verbal irony, that is, irony portrayed by an ironist (leader, spokesperson, advocate of a group) who is intentionally being ironic. These ironic perspectives do not reXect a pretense of ignorance or a suspension of belief, or convey the opposite of literal meaning for humorous or sardonic eVect. In short, the ironic perspectives are not forms of rhetorical deception or trickery. What they reveal is how each group views the other, through discourse, as arrogant, complacent, blindly self-conWdent, and most of all, unaware of its own irony. Each group views the other as an ironic victim, not simply because it is being deceived by someone or something, but because it should know better than to behave the way it does, but does not do so. Both of the ironic perspectives held by the competing interest groups are situational and tragic. They reveal what D. C. Muecke identiWes as a "Situational Irony" in which there is "no ironist but always both a victim and an observer" of the situation. Thus one group identiWes a tragic, "ironical personiWed Fate" unfolding from the actions of the other, but it does so as the "observer" of the situation, not as an "ironist" who is intentionally being ironic. This type of irony can also be considered "Unintentional or Unconscious," but the discourse itself represents an ironic perspective of the situation for the competing groups, one that serves a strategic and rhetorical purpose in the controversy at hand.2 Each group observes the other's situation and each group is characterized ironically by the other as the source of the tragic fate. However, since the ironic perspectives hold tragic endings for everyone, each group can only avoid tragedy (that is, the tragedy they see caused by the other group) and survive by eliminating the other group. The perspectives constrain Clinton because they are mutually exclusive. They solidify each group through division, and they would appear to eliminate opportunities to create or restore middle, or common, ground. Under these circumstances Clinton merely fueled the Wre and alienated himself from both groups in the conXict. But in doing so, an opportunity arose for him to do what he perhaps does best, that is "reinvent" himself on the issue. I identify irony as constraint in the timber controversy, examine President Clinton's response to that constraint as a "rhetorical reinvention," then consider implications of irony and reinvention as functions of presidential rhetoric. From a mere Wgure of speech, irony has become a phenomenon of considerable cultural and rhetorical importance. Perhaps the most sophisticated weapon at the disposal of satire, irony typically produces a masterful blend of both comic and tragic awareness. When viewed as ironic, life situations, either real, invented, or reinvented, can be presented to audiences as a corrective device that exposes ignorance, pride, vanity, and hypocrisy. For this study, irony is considered in general as an incongruity between the actual result of a situation, or a sequence of events, and the normal or expected result. As David Kaufer notes, "irony has come to signify a split perspective of appearance and reality in all its forms." More speciWcally, situational irony, the type of irony expressed by the timber industry and environmentalists, points out incongruities between appearance and reality but without the deceit, the pretense, or the suspension of a belief. Though there is no ironist or mocker, who is intentionally ironic, there are victims and observers. Victims of such situational irony are singled out and distinguished as "in the wrong" as opposed to those observing the wrongdoers who are, at least in this one particular case, "in the right."3 But a search for irony in the paradoxes, contradictions, and ambiguities of life does not always lead to a sympathetic understanding of that life or generate a greater sense of cooperation among its listeners. On the contrary, irony usually creates and depends on a sense of detachment from and superiority over audiences and intended victims. This "dissociative" function, which is common in situational irony, has been identiWed by Kenneth Burke as well as Muecke and others in what is called "romantic irony." With romantic irony, as Burke states, the ironist has no "kinship with the enemy" but stands apart from and superior to the role being rejected.4 It is this dissociative function of romantic irony that surfaces most clearly in the situational ironies of competing groups in the forest controversy to constrain Clinton's rhetoric. However, with no ironist purposely trying to be ironic, the rejection of and superiority over one group by another is sincere. Thus, the situational ironies in the controversy are dissociative like romantic irony, but not deceptively so. The dissociative and unsympathetic attitudes that Burke identiWes in romantic irony also combine with those of preference and aloofness. Soren Kierkegaard believes irony by deWnition contains a "certain exclusiveness" and "looks down . . . on plain and ordinary discourse immediately understood by everyone; it travels in an exclusive incognito . . . and looks down from its exalted station." In The Ironic Temper Haakon Chevalier notes that "the ironic spirit has always inclined toward detachment," and the "ironist is committed to the search of a more and more exterior point of view, [one in which] noth ing else is superior." Alan Reynolds Thompson observes in The Dry Mock that unlike other types of discourse "one must be detached and cool" to perceive irony. Northrop Frye states, "the ironist is most like the poet in the sense that they both turn their back on the audience." And Wnally, Muecke notes that all irony features an element of detachment or disengagement that creates a sense of distance among victims and audiences.© 2004 by Texas A&M University Press.

AB  - Natural communities dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) once covered an estimated two thirds of the forested area in the southeastern United States. Today, less than 1.2 million ha remain. However, over the past 10-15 years, public land managers have begun to restore many longleaf pine forests. More recently incentive programs have prompted reforestation and afforestation programs on nonindustrial private lands. These activities have been facilitated by improved longleaf regeneration technology and by expanded educational and outreach efforts. In the South, there is also a growing trend towards longer rotations due to changes in wood/fiber markets and prices. These trends suggest a new strategy to increase terrestrial carbon storage in the southeastern United States in a way that provides many simultaneous ecological and economic benefits. For example, longleaf pine is a long-lived species with a low mortality rate. Among the southern pine species, it has a high specific gravity and can tolerate a very wide variety of habitats. Longleaf pine is better able to sustain growth at older ages (over 150 years) and is tolerant to fire and many insects and diseases. Recent research also indicates that longleaf pine managed for longer rotations outperforms other commercial southern pine species on most sites and might better adapt to future climate scenarios with higher temperatures and higher atmospheric CO2 levels. Moreover, the higher-value, longer-lasting wood products derived from longleaf pine forests will continue to store carbon over long time periods. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.

AB  - The mixed oak-pine ecosystems in the southern Appalachians are in decline because of a combination of drought and southern pine-beetle infestation. A commonly applied prescription for restoration of these degraded sites has been to fell all vegetation, allow it to dry, and conduct a site-preparation burn. However, there is little information on the mid- and long-term influences of this prescription on nutrient cycling. The fell-and-burn treatment was applied to three mixed oak-pine stands in the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. Each stand had an untreated control area. Our objective was to determine the effects of this treatment on soil nutrient availability and potential nutrient loss. Exchangeable soil cations, pH, total carbon (C), and total nitrogen (N) were measured before and periodically for 5 years after treatment. Nitrogen transformations and nutrient availability in soil solution and in a stream draining one site were measured before and periodically for 3 years after burning. Exchangeable calcium and magnesium concentrations, soil pH, and N availability increased after treatment. There was no treatment effect on total soil C or N. Nitrogen mineralization rates were greater on burned versus control plots in 50% of the posttreatment measurements. This treatment increased nutrient availability and, although a significant amount of total site N was lost, there were no adverse effects on total soil nutrients or water quality.

AB  - Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections. These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges. The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation. Policy-relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. The group recommended creating Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities. The centers' objectives would be 3-fold: a) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health; b) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and c) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.

AB  - Allegheny woodrats (Neotoma magister) currently receive protected status throughout their range due to population declines. Threats associated with habitat fragmentation (e.g., introduced predators, disease, loss of connectivity among subpopulations and habitat loss) may explain why Allegheny woodrats are no longer found in many areas where they existed just 25 y ago. In southern West Virginia, surface coal mining is a major cause of forest fragmentation. Furthermore, mountaintop mining, the prevalent method in the region, results in a loss of rock outcrops and cliffs within forested areas, typical habitat of the Allegheny woodrat To determine the extent that Allegheny woodrats make use of reclaimed mine land, particularly rock drainages built during reclamation, we sampled 24 drainage channels on reclaimed surface mines in southern West Virginia, collected habitat data at each site and used logistic regression to identify habitat variables related to Allegheny woodrat presence. During 187 trap nights, 13 adult, 2 subadult and 8 juvenile Allegheny woodrats were captured at 13 of the 24 sites. Percent of rock as a groundcover and density of stems >15 cm diameter-at-breast-height (DBH) were related to Allegheny woodrat presence and were significantly greater at sites where Allegheny woodrats were present than absent. Sites where Allegheny woodrats were present differed substantially from other described habitats in West Virginia, though they may simulate boulder piles that occur naturally. Our findings suggest the need for additional research to examine the dynamics between Allegheny woodrat populations inhabiting rock outcrops in forests adjacent to mines and populations inhabiting constructed drainage channels on reclaimed mines. However, if Allegheny woodrats can use human-created habitat, our results will be useful to surface mine reclamation and to other mitigation efforts where rocky habitats are lost or disturbed.

AB  - Presenilin 1 (PS1) plays a critical role in cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce amyloid-β (Aβ), the primary proteinaceous component of the senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to mediating the cleavage of APP and a number of other proteins, a growing body of evidence suggests that PS1 also regulates intracellular endoplasmic reticulum calcium levels. Such findings suggest that PS1 activity may modulate neuronal excitability, as well. To address this issue we examined cytosolic intracellular calcium responses in PS1-deficient neurons stimulated by the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter, glutamate. We found that glutamate-induced intracellular calcium levels were markedly reduced in neurons lacking PS1 (-/-) compared with heterozygous (+/-) and wild-type (+/+) neurons. To prove that PS1 was sufficient to mediate normal glutamate-induced calcium responses, we used a Semliki-forest virus (SFV) vector to express wild-type PS1 in PS1 knock-out neurons. We found that heterologous PS1 expression restored glutamate-evoked calcium responses in PS1-deficient neurons to levels matching non-infected wild-type cells. PS1-deficient neurons infected with SFV directing expression of β-galactosidase failed to rescue the wild-type phenotype. These results support the idea that normal PS1 activity regulates neuronal responses to neurotransmitter stimulation.

AB  - American chestnut is one of hundreds of plant species plagued by root rot caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi. Phytophthora root rot is thought to have contributed to chestnut dieback prior to the arrival of chestnut blight, and it may now present a serious limitation to establishment of blight-resistant hybrid chestnut. We manipulated soil compaction and moisture to evaluate the effect of soil physical factors on incidence of Phytophthora root rot on American chestnut seedlings. Seedlings were grown under three watering regimes, two soil compaction levels and two fungicide levels. Increased soil moisture enhanced seedling growth in loose soil, but irrigation did not impact seedlings growing in compacted soils. Seedling mortality was greatest in wet, compacted soils. Disease incidence was highest in the wettest soils, irrespective of compaction level. Fine root necrosis and Phytophthora infection occurred on 58 and 24% of non-fungicide-treated seedlings, respectively. Presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi declined in compacted soils that were either wetter or drier than optimal. Occurrence of ectomycorrhizal fungal symbionts was unrelated to root rot. This study demonstrates the high susceptibility of American chestnut to this common root pathogen, even under moderate levels of soil compaction and moisture. While overcoming chestnut blight is the first step in restoring chestnut to its original range, to establish successful plantings it will be crucial to recognize and avoid sites where soil physical factors promote Phytophthora root rot. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Ecological restoration is a young discipline that focuses upon the biotic and abiotic rehabilitation of natural systems an order to restore its structure and functional properties. The study of ecological restoration in tropical forests has concentrated on identifying the barriers that limit recovery, with the aim of accelerating secondary succession. These barriers include : 1) lack of dispersal or propagules in the seed bank, 2) low germination rates, and 3) low rates of seedling recruitment due to the negative effects of diseases, predation and competition, or adverse physical conditions. Based on the analysis of literature from the last 20 years on ecological restoration in tropical forests, this work reviews the state of the art and perspectives in this area of research. The analysis indicated that 64% of the studies have been conducted in tropical rain forests, that 55% of them are mainly descriptive, and that the experimental studies tend to evaluate only one or two limiting barriers, rather than concentrating on a long term integrative approach. Nevertheless, there is a promising future for restoration ecology; the experimental approach has grown exponentially and the social component is being included in lire projects. Ecological restoration is consolidating itself as an integrative discipline, keeping in mind all the necessary aspects (ecological, social, economic) to achieve the recovery and conservation of the natural systems.

AB  - Management of near-to-nature forests is frequently supplanted by faster-growing 'industrial' plantations on the basis of the latter's superior economic return. These latter species often produce higher volumes of usable biomass in shorter periods of time. Increased yields come with a price, however. While some species provide a superior net present value, they may require a higher cash flow position on the part of the landowner. Other species may possess superior production capabilities but are susceptible to insect and disease attack. Under such conditions, less productive 'native' species might produce a satisfactory rate of return considering their reduced risk of attack. We examine two methods of evaluating differences in effective yield and rate of return. The first method, expected value analysis, is a deterministic method that uses decision tree methodology coupled with pre-determined probabilities of outcome for a given series of events and choices. The second method is a matrix model using stochastic transitions between healthy trees and different states of poor health. Markov processes are used to drive simulations of insect and disease attack, and then calculate net present value and optimal rotation age. We keep the final per-unit product price fixed to simplify the analysis and better validate the comparison between the deterministic and stochastic methods. We use longleaf (Pinus palustris Mill.), loblolly (P. taeda L.), shortleaf (P. echinata Mill.) and slash (P. elliottii Engelm.) pines as the species in our comparison. Longleaf is the slowest growing, but it is less prone to attack than the other three. Using more recent Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, both our Markov analysis and expected value analysis found loblolly and slash pines to be superior economic performers. Earlier FIA surveys support the selection of loblolly and slash over longleaf, but suggest that higher fusiform incidence might push the investment decision towards longleaf pine, particularly vis-à-vis slash pine at higher site indices. Both analysis methods provided the same outcomes, so long as they used the same data. Given this result, a decision tree methodology is a reasonable method for evaluating the economics of species choice in forest restoration activities.

AB  - The quality of planted seeds has a critical influence on the ability of crops to become established and to realize their full potential of yield. Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) are forest trees species, both native to the southern United States of America, mostly planted in Northeastern Argentina for site restoration and forest management due to their fast growth on diverse sites. Numerous diseases attack these two pine species in forest nurseries: damping-off and root rot. Many Fusarium species present on seeds were found to be associated with damping-off and root diseases in loblolly and slash pine seedlings. Seed of Pinus elliottii and P. taeda were collected from Northeastern Argentina and analyzed for seed-borne Fusarium. Seed treatments as running water for 24 and 48 h were tested for effectiveness in changing Fusarium populations on seeds. Seven different species of Fusarium were isolated from the seed lots assayed: F. solani, F. verticillioides (= F. moniliforme), F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. incarnatum (= F. pallidoroseum = F. semitectum), F. equiseti and F. acuminatum. Fusarium populations detected on seeds changed after running water treatments for 24 and 48 h but this changes varied among seedlots. This is the first report on Fusarium species associated with P. elliottii and P. taeda seeds in Argentina.

AB  - Whether originating from the African primates in the Central African forest, or from polio vaccine trials by some western scientists, there is no doubt that HIV/AIDS poses the greatest single challenge to the marginalized poor of Africa, where it has found a malnourished, vulnerable, defenceless host. Collective response is necessary by physicians and health professionals who must be at the forefront of restoring hope and a dignified quality of life. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS is not a security threat but a painful slow death which forces victims into exhausting their lifetime savings on expensive medicines and massive hospital bills. It leaves helpless orphans to struggle for survival in countries where government subsidy on education and healthcare has been long withdrawn so as to channel the meagre state resources into debt servicing. A combination of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and Third World debt is subjecting millions of children to the worst form of violence. This article reviews the situation in sub-Saharan Africa, with special reference to Kenya and South Africa as examples of countries devastated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Changes elsewhere are noted and the global response is critically examined.

AB  - We investigated herbivore suitability, foliar chemistry, and seedling growth of blight-susceptible pure American chestnut, Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh., and a blight-resistant Chinese chestnut, Castanea mollisima Blume X American chestnut hybrid, using supplemental fertilizer and ectomycorrhizal inoculation to affect nutrient availability and nutrient uptake, and the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), to measure herbivore suitability. Gypsy moth performance was best on fertilized hybrid seedlings, and was lowest on untreated American chestnut seedlings. Foliar carbohydrates were greatest, and tannin levels were lowest, in mycorrhizae-inoculated American chestnut. Foliar nitrogen was also high in mycorrhizal American chestnut, and was equivalent to that found in fertilized seedlings of both species. American chestnut seedlings had greater height and diameter growth than hybrids, regardless of soil amendments. Our results suggest that blight resistance may exact a cost in plant growth and productivity for this chestnut hybrid, and may enhance plant suitability for a generalist herbivore. Additionally, enhanced gypsy moth performance on blight-resistant chestnut hybrids has implications with respect to the restoration of chestnut to eastern deciduous forests, because intense herbivore pressure could compromise seedling growth and survival, and play a role in sustaining potentially damaging gypsy moth populations. The implications of this work within the context of current theories addressing herbivore-plant relations are discussed.

AB  - Aim: We evaluated how an elevation gradient affects: (1) the availability of food required by a specialist seed-eater, Loxioides bailleui Oustalet (Drepanidinae), or pallia, and hence the distribution of this endangered Hawaiian bird, and (2) the distribution of alien threats to Loxioides populations, their primary foods, and their dry-forest habitat, and hence strategies for their conservation. Location: We worked throughout the subalpine forest that encircles Mauna Kea Volcano, Hawai'i Island, but we focused our studies mainly on the western slope between 2000 and 3000 m elevation, where the gradient of elevation was greatest and palila were most abundant. Methods: We determined phenology and productivity patterns of the endemic dry-forest tree species, Sophora chrysophylla (Salisb.) Seem. (Fabaceae), or māmane, which provides Loxioides with most of their food, and another common endemic tree, Myoporum sandwicense A. Gray (Myoporaceae), or naio, which provides some resources, along a 786-m elevation gradient at monthly intervals for 10 years (Sophora only). We also determined the availability each month of moth larvae (Lepidoptera) for that were important in the diet of nestling and adult palila. In addition, we documented the incidence of parasitism on moth larvae by several wasp (Hymenoptera) and fly (Diptera) species, and we determined the distribution of predatory wasps and ants (Hymenoptera), which potentially threaten insect prey of birds. Percentage cover of alien grass species that pose fire threats in palila habitat and other weeds were assessed during one survey. Small mammal abundance and distribution were determined by trapping during three (rodent) or five (carnivore) surveys. Results: Sophora flower and seed (pod) availability varied predictably along the elevation gradient, with about 4 months separating peaks in reproduction at high and low elevations. This, together with highly variable production of flowers and pods within elevation strata, resulted in Sophora resources being available to Loxioides throughout the year on the western slope of Mauna Kea. Sophora produced flowers and pods more seasonally where gradients of elevation were short; thus, resources were available less consistently. In contrast, Myoporum produced flowers and fruits with little variation with respect to season or elevation. The availability of important insect prey of Loxioides was also related to elevation, in part because threats to Lepidoptera larvae from parasitic wasps were generally less at higher elevations. Threats to insect prey from predatory ants was also less at higher elevations but the abundance of predatory wasps was not related to elevation. Several weeds that pose the most serious threats to Loxioides habitat were more abundant at mid and low elevations, and alien grass cover was somewhat greater at mid elevation, thereby increasing fire risks in the centre of Loxioides habitat. Predatory mammals, in particular Felis catus Linnaeus, were common throughout the subalpine forest of Mauna Kea. However, Rattus rattus Linnaeus was rare, especially at higher elevations, whereas Mus musculus Linnaeus was more abundant at lower elevations. Main conclusions: Loxioides are concentrated in habitat that is distributed along a substantial gradient of elevation at least in part because food is available throughout the year and threats to food resources are less concentrated. To recover Loxioides elsewhere in its former range, habitats must be restored and alien threats reduced along extensive elevation gradients. Conservation along environmental gradients will likely benefit other Hawaiian birds that track the availability of food across landscapes or that have been stranded in the higher portions of their original ranges because of the greater impacts of alien diseases, predators, food competitors, and habitat stressors at lower elevations.

AB  - Relatively high levels of blister rust infection in some stands of genetically improved western white pine (Pinus monticola) raised concerns that resistance may fail under field conditions. However, surveys show consistently lower infection and mortality in genetically improved white pine compared to unimproved stock. Restoring white pine by continued breeding for high levels of rust resistance, increased planting of resistant seedlings, and other silvicultural treatments are recommended to help alleviate forest health problems in Inland Northwest forests.

AB  - The O'ahu 'Elepaio Chasiempis sandwichensis ibidis is an endangered monarch flycatcher endemic to the Hawaiian island of O'ahu. Nest predation by alien Black Rats Rattus rattus is one of the main causes of the decline of this forest bird. From 1996 to 2000 we monitored demography of the largest remaining O'ahu 'Elepaio population and we controlled rats with snap traps and poison bait stations in an attempt to begin recovery of the species. Nest predation by Black Rats influenced many aspects of 'Elepaio demography. Rat control resulted in a 112% increase in 'Elepaio reproduction, a 66% increase in survival of female 'Elepaio, and restored mate fidelity, site fidelity, female age structure, and female recruitment age to more natural conditions. The 'Elepaio population growth rate (lambda) was 0.76 without rat control and 1.00 with rat control, indicating rat control stabilized 'Elepaio populations, but was not sufficient to cause population increase due to the added threat of alien mosquito-borne diseases. Rat control may facilitate evolution of disease resistance by providing birds that have greater natural immunity an increased chance of reproducing, thereby increasing the proportion of resistant birds in each subsequent generation more quickly.

AB  - This paper documents methods for assessing the potential effects of variable-intensity management in late-successional reserves (LSRs) and provides an example (the Gotchen LSR) from the Cascade Range in eastern Washington. The Gotchen LSR study investigates changes in forest vegetation associated with silvicultural treatments, and how different treatment combinations may affect landscape patterns, LSR habitat objectives, fire hazard, and the characteristics and value of wood removed over space and time. The study contributes to the conceptual and technical development of a decision-analysis tool, the northeastern Cascades landscape analysis, management, and monitoring system (NOCLAMMS), for land management. Landscape evaluation of the Gotchen LSR reveals that since the 1930s, forest structures have become more homogeneous; area and average patch size of young, multistoried forest stands have decreased; and spatial patterns of late-successional forest have changed. These changes alter vegetation response to disturbances like fires, insects, and diseases, and suggest that different structures and patterns may better support LSR objectives over space and time. Study results aid in identifying candidate treatment areas, in developing prescriptions to maintain or restore desired stand structures and patterns, and in understanding the financial commitment necessary for different management actions. Silvicultural treatments are applied by using the forest vegetation simulator (FVS). The financial evaluation of ecosystem management activities (FEEMA) software is used to calculate net revenues associated with different treatments. Results from one stand illustrate these methods.

AB  - Vegetation patterns in eastern Oregon and Washington are largely a result of environmental conditions, species distributions, plant ecology, and disturbances operating at multiple scales and in different environments. In turn, vegetative patterns strongly influence the amount, severity, and distribution of disturbances generated by various agents. This paper focuses on the latter - the relations between vegetation pattern, disturbance, and forest health and productivity. At all scales, vulnerability to disturbance appears to increase when vegetation condition and pattern differs from the historical or expected range for a given environment. Generally, forests that are older, composed of larger trees, denser, more homogeneous, or more contiguous than would be expected under natural or historical disturbance regimes are more vulnerable to mortality from insects and disease. Factors related to vulnerability include site potential, host abundance, canopy structure, host size, patch vigor, patch density, patch connectivity, topography, and logging disturbance. Mortality from insects and disease contributes to diverse habitat, but current levels of tree mortality from insects and disease are often outside the historical or expected range given site environment. High levels of mortality may continue because many forests have become more homogeneous, contiguous, and dominated by shade-tolerant species owing to fire suppression and management. Uncharacteristically severe fires will likely increase in the next 100 years even with restoration management because of changed vegetation patterns and other factors. Information at stand or site scales is relatively abundant in the scientific and management literature. Much broad-scale information is based on models and expert opinion. Research at broad scales is scanty and difficult.

AB  - Effects of fire, forest insects and diseases, grazing, and forest health treatments on fish populations and habitat are reviewed. Fire, insects, and disease affect fish habitat by their influence on the rate and volume of woody debris recruitment to streams, canopy cover and water temperature, stream flow, channel erosion, sedimentation, nutrients, and residual vegetation. Physical effects from fire vary greatly depending on fire severity and extent, geology, soil, topography, and orientation of the site, and subsequent precipitation. Most effects moderate within a decade. Post-fire erosion and wood recruitment are also influenced by fire lines, road construction, and timber harvest. Although some disturbances, such as severe fire and subsequent floods, appear catastrophic, and effects may last decades or centuries, natural disturbances help create and maintain diverse, productive aquatic habitats. Recolonization of fish populations following wildfires can be rapid and is related to occurrence of local refugia, life history patterns, access for migratory forms, and distribution of the species. In most livestock studies, grazing negatively affected fish habitat and populations, but results may vary depending on sites and specific grazing management. Effective approaches to grazing management similarly depend on the specific application and the commitment of operators and managers. Restoration of the structure, function, and processes of watersheds more similar to those with which native species evolved may favor those species; however, there is little documentation of the aquatic effects of those activities. Risk from vegetative treatments may be minimized by experimenting outside of critical areas (i.e., conserving key habitats and populations, focusing intensive treatments on upland sites). Use of more benign techniques (e.g., lower-impact logging systems) and pulsed treatments consistent with characteristics of natural disturbance regimes are other considerations for achieving both terrestrial and aquatic objectives.

AB  - Healthy forests and rangelands are resilient to disturbances within a certain range of variation. In eastern Oregon and Washington, ecosystems have evolved in the presence of sporadic disturbances such as fire, floods, and insect and disease outbreaks. Ecological and human factors have combined to change disturbance regimes, structure, and patterns resulting in declining health and productivity in forest and rangeland ecosystems. We expect that with improved understanding of disturbance processes and careful management of the drivers of disturbance it is possible to enhance ecosystem resiliency. As an aid to managers in determining actions that may be successful in restoring resilience to ecosystems, we describe linkages among components that may enable managers to harness beneficial effects of disturbances while minimizing the adverse effects. A conceptual framework presented here identifies relations among factors that managers can influence, and that are important to ecological processes and outcomes. Integrating social and economic components helps managers to balance what the land will allow, what people want, and what society can afford. Influence diagrams help identify important linkages and the areas where research may help to weigh tradeoffs.

AB  - Root diseases are important natural disturbance agents affecting all tree species and all forest ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest. They influence stand structure, density, composition, function, and yield. The root diseases of greatest concern in eastern Washington and Oregon are annosus root disease, Armillaria root disease, laminated root rot, and black stain root disease. For these diseases some information is available on root disease ecology, population dynamics, biology of the pathogens, and the natural processes that regulate them. Less is known about disease effects at the watershed or landscape level or how diseases interact with other disturbances and how they respond to management strategies. Decision support, such as the Western Root Disease Model, is being developed. In response to a shift in forest species and structure following a century of fire suppression and partial cutting, root diseases are believed to have spread causing more inoculum on more sites than existed in historical times. Stand management to restore historical vegetation conditions may intensify disease; however, in cases where diseased stands are converted to seral species, incidence and severity of root diseases will likely decline. Treatments that retain high stocking of host species, or allow host regeneration, will likely result in increased levels of root diseases because inoculum remains on the site. Spore infections may increase with partial cutting where stumps are not chemically treated. Disturbance increases activity of some insects, which may act as vectors of root disease pathogens.

AB  - Current and potential future conditions of terrestrial plant communities and landscape health were modeled for three alternative public land management strategies in the interior Columbia River basin. Landscape health was defined as an integration of the degree to which vegetation and disturbance conditions resemble native patterns and support levels of human activity. The range of vegetation and disturbance variability for a period before the middle 19th century was used as a basis for comparison of current and future regimes to the "historical" system. Departure from the "historical" regime in wildland environments was found to be related to altered disturbance patterns, especially changed fire regimes, forest insect and disease levels and excessive livestock grazing effects. Overall, mid-seral forests are currently more prevalent than they were in the past and old forests, especially single-layer structural types, are less abundant. Non-native plant species and altered plant community composition conditions exist across broad areas of rangelands. Landscape health has declined substantially in many areas. Proposed management strategies that emphasize maintenance and restoration activities in a hierarchical landscape approach should generate improved landscape health conditions over the next 100 years. However, the massive scale of changes to disturbance and vegetation patterns from historical to current times and the cost of implementing restoration activities make dramatic improvement unlikely.

AB  - Rehabilitation of large gully erosions was improved in Piracicaba (Brazil) by using worn-out tires. Two procedures were evaluated in different case studies, the "ditch technique" (DT) and the "fill-up technique" (FT). In both, worn-out tires were placed at the bottom of the gullies, covered (naturally or artificially) with soil and reforested. In the DT the tires were placed in small pyramidal barriers perpendicular to the gully along its bottom and in the FT they were used as filling material occupying the lower part of the whole gully. The benefits of the suggested methods are an adequate disposal of worn-out tires, restoration of forest resources and the control of the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, whose larvae develop extremely well in the clean water accumulated in open-air stored tires. This mosquito species is vector of the tropical epidemic disease dengue fever. The paper reports on two case studies substantiating the practicability of the methods. The multiple advantages and the need of none or little capital investments for the adoption of the technologies contribute for its acceptance by decision makers, politicians and society.

AB  - Increased use of forest resources and a shrinking forestland base threaten the sustainability of forest genetic resources and highlight the importance of conservation and sustainable management of these resources. As forest trees are normally the keystone species of forest ecosystems, their continued existence is essential for many floral and faunal associations of these ecosystems. Major concepts, challenges and opportunities for conservation of forest genetic resources are briefly discussed in this paper. The major challenges include population decline and population structure changes due to forest removal and conversion of forest land to other uses, forest fragmentation, forestry practices, climate change, disease conditions, introduced pests, atmospheric pollution, and introgressive hybridization. Developing scientifically sound conservation strategies, maintaining minimum viable population sizes, and deployment of genetically engineered organisms represent other important challenges in conservation. The usefulness of various biochemical and molecular genetic markers, adaptive traits, and genetic diversity measures for developing conservation strategies for in situ and ex situ genetic resource conservation are also discussed. Major opportunities for conservation of forest genetic resources include: use of molecular genetic markers and adaptive traits for developing conservation strategies; in situ conservation through natural reserves, protected areas, and sustainable forest management practices; ex situ conservation through germplasm banks, common garden archives, seed banks, DNA banks, and tissue culture and cryopreservation; incorporation of disease, pest, and stress tolerance traits through genetic transformation; plantation forestry; and ecological restoration of rare or declining tree species and populations. Forest genetic resource conservation and resource use should be considered complementary rather than contradictory to each other.

AB  - On the Monterey Peninsula, many native stands of Monterey pine are overmature, largely as a result of fire suppression. In addition, the pathogen that causes pitch canker has recently been introduced and is now well established. Management practices aimed at increasing natural regeneration will convert these forests to younger age classes in which ecological and evolutionary processes are optimized within the constraints imposed by fire suppression, pitch canker, and occupation of the forest by humans.

AB  - Livestock have played a pivotal and positive role in human development. Yet this has come at a heavy cost to the biological diversity of the world's rangelands and forests. Livestock grazing is the most widespread land use occurring on Earth. In many regions of the world, grazing has reduced the density and biomass of many plant and animal species, reduced biodiversity, aided in the spread of exotic species and disease, altered ecological succession and landscape heterogeneity, altered nutrient cycles and distribution, accelerated erosion, and diminished both the productivity and land use options for future generations. Rangelands, a general term for grasslands, savannas, semi-arid shrublands, and woodlands, are a dominant terrestrial land cover type in all continents (except Antarctica). They contain a significant portion of the world's biodiversity. Ecosystem degradation or desertification associated with livestock grazing is a significant problem throughout these rangelands. In addition, the majority of tropical forests in South and Central America are being deforested at alarming rates primarily for conversion to cattle pasture. In effect, the most biologically diverse ecosystems on Earth are being converted to simple pastures dominated by exotic grasses. To halt this degradation or to restore native ecosystems, innovative approaches to land use and livestock management need to be implemented. Ecosystems should be managed such that natural ecological and physical processes are allowed to occur with minimal disruption. Governmental institutions and policies are among the most significant barriers to land use change. © 2001 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A plot of 225 m2 in the 1st generation Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) monoculture (age 77-92 years) in the research plot at Rájec nad Svitavou (altitude 625-640 m, 49° 20′ 37″ northern latitude (φ), 16° 42′ 1″ eastern longitude (λ), operated by the Institute of Forest Ecology was roofed for the period of 1983-1985. The roof was erected under the crowns of about twenty trees and its purpose was to induce drought stress. The paper presents a confrontation of biometric characteristics of shoots from top and basal crown parts, studied in three research phases as follows: 1. In 1980-1985: study of the roof impact (Vondřejc, 1986); 2. In 1984-1990: study of regeneration typo (Zvolánkovä, 1993); 3. In 1990-1997: evaluation of experimental results in comparison with results obtained under conditions of naturally occurring droughts. Drought stress led to the decrease in the size of transpiration and assimilatory compartments (area, surface, needle dry matter, etc.), to the restriction of shoot elongation and diameter growth, and to the general reduction of DM accumulation. Some of parameters were to a considerable extent predicted by the conditions of the preceding year (such as needle number per shoot), other were depending on whether the drought occurred in the period from May to June (stem length) or later (DM accumulation) with annual ring area depending on the conditions of the current year. Healthy individuals recovered and restored the original growth rate after two to three years after the water stress (roof) was removed. The methods of growth analysis made it possible to identify the stress impact and to find a different behaviour of the top and basal parts of crowns or that of the healthy and weakened individuals. Regarding the fact that the ratio between the annual precipitation amounts and annual average temperature was decreased in the course of several successive years down to values close to scmiarid regions (1989, 1992), or the precipitation were low (1993), or the temperatures high above average (1994), some biometric characteristics (in the third phase of research, i. c. in 1990-1997) reached the values close to those found at the artificially induced water stress by roofing the plot. In a non-autochthonous environment the tree species must face a repeated water stress (low precipitation and their fluctuation) and a temperature stress (supraoptimum or frost temperatures combined with insufficient snow cover). All this results in weakening, precocious ageing and development of fungal diseases.

AB  - Torreya taxifolia is a coniferous tree that is endemic to the 35 km stretch of bluffs and ravines along the east side of the Apalachicola River in northern Florida and adjacent southern Georgia. This formerly locally abundant tree declined during the 1950s and 1960s as a result of disease and is currently on the US Endangered Species list. For sparsely distributed species it can often be difficult to determine both current and historic population sizes. Historical descriptions of the distribution (203 km2) and relative abundance (14.2% of dominant ravine trees) of T. taxifolia are used along with current measures of forest structure to estimate the pre-decline population density (30 trees/ha) and size (~0.3-0.65 million individuals). Survey information from five extant stands is used to estimate current population size (~500-4000 individuals). The surveys were conducted in areas with known high tree denSities such that a simple extrapolation to the entire distribution would produce a gross over-estimate of population size. We therefore use a variety of assumptions to produce a range of estimates for total population sizes. RegardleSs of the particular model, our estimates suggest that T. taxifolia has lost at least 98.5% of its total population size since the early 1900s. We discuss these results in relation to the potential difficulties likely of restoring sustainable populations of this species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch.) (WPBR) was discovered on Ribes L. in New York in 1906, although it was accidentally introduced from Europe on pine (Pinus L.) seedlings. The spread of this destructive fungus has changed the forests in North America. After decades of reduced planting because of the concern over the impact of WPBR, white pine (Pinus strobus L.) is now being restored in the lake states of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Although the potential for growing white pine is high on many sites, the disappearance of a seed source because of logging and fires means that reestablishment of white pine to these areas will require active management. A series of plantings have been established on three national forests in Minnesota and Michigan to evaluate various silvicultural treatments intended to minimize the incidence of WPBR and to compare the performance of seedlings selected for disease resistance to nonselected planting stock.

AB  - Ten agricultural wastes were tested for their suitability as substrates for the growth of cabbage seedlings. Spent forest mushroom compost (SFMC) and spent golden mushroom compost (SGMC) were found to be more suitable than raw spent forest mushroom growth medium (RFM), raw spent golden mushroom growth medium (RGM), rice hull, carbonized rice hull, peanut husk, coconut fiber, bagasse meal or wasted cotton. The optimum composting period for SFMC and SGMC was 10 and 6 weeks, respectively. A new container medium (SSC-06) was formulated using SFMC, carbonized rice hull, shrimp and crab shell meal, blood waste, and lime. The SSC-06 medium was suitable for growth of cabbage seedlings and was suppressive to Rhizoctonia solani AG-4. The suppressive effect of 20-day-old SSC-06 medium on colonization of cabbage seeds by R. solani AG-4 was reduced after it was steamed in 100°C hot air for 15~30 min. However, the inhibitory effect was restored to the steamed SSC-06 medium by inoculation with Trichoderma harzianum isolate TH-05 at a concentration of 105 cfu/g dry medium. After the medium was steamed for 5, 10, 15, 25 or 30 min, no fungal colonies were recovered, but the colony-forming units of the bacterial population were maintained at &gt;106/g dry medium. The potential for SSC-06 as a container medium for commercial nursery industries is discussed.

AB  - Management activities of the 20th century, especially fire exclusion, timber harvest, and domestic livestock grazing, have significantly modified vegetation spatial patterns of forests and ranges in the interior Columbia basin. Compositional patterns as well as patterns of living and dead structure have changed. Dramatic change in vital ecosystem processes such as fire, insect, and pathogen disturbances, succession, and plant and animal migration is linked to recent change in vegetation patterns. Recent change in vegetation patterns is also a primary reason for current low viability and threatened, endangered, or sensitive status of numerous native plant and animal species. Although well intentioned, 20th-century management practices have not accounted for the larger patterns of living and dead vegetation that enable forest ecosystems to function in perpetuity and maintain their structure and organization through time, or for the disturbances that create and maintain them. Knowledge of change in vegetation patterns enhances resource manager and public awareness of patterns that better correspond with current climate, site conditions, and native disturbance regimes, and improves understanding of conditions to which native terrestrial species have already adapted. In this study, we characterized recent historical and current vegetation composition and structure of 337 randomly sampled subwatersheds (9500 ha average size), in 43 of 164 total subbasins (404 000 ha average size), selected by stratified random draw on all ownerships within the interior Columbia River basin and portions of the Klamath and Great Basins (collectively referred to as the basin). We compared landscape patterns, vegetation structure and composition, and landscape vulnerability to 21 major insect and pathogen disturbances of historical and current vegetation coverages. For each selected subwatershed, we constructed historical and current vegetation maps from interpretations of 1932-66 and 1981-93 aerial photos, respectively. Areas with homogeneous vegetation composition and structure were delineated as patches to a minimum size of 4 ha. We then attributed cover types (composition), structural classes (structure), and series-level potential vegetation types (site potential) to individual patches within subwatersheds by modeling procedures. We characterized change in vegetation spatial patterns by using an array of class and landscape pattern metrics and a spatial pattern analysis program. Finally, we translated change in vegetation patterns to change in landscape vulnerability to major forest pathogen and insect disturbances. Change analyses results were reported for province-scale ecological reporting units. Forest and range ecosystems are significantly altered after their first century of active management, but there is reason for guarded optimism. Large areas remain relatively unchanged and intact, such as can be found on the east side of the Cascade Range in Washington and in the central Idaho mountains, and these areas may provide an essential 'nucleus' for conservation strategies and ecosystem restoration. Strategies for improving the health of basin ecosystems can build on existing strengths. Improved understanding of change in vegetation patterns, causative factors, and links with disturbance processes will assist managers and policymakers in making informed decisions about how to address important ecosystem health issues.

AB  - Soil organisms have become a focus of attention for addressing issues of soil quality and health, and ecosystem sustainability. Land managers are challenged to ensure that their actions are beneficial to belowground organisms and processes in the long-term. Research about soil organisms, their populations, roles, and management effects is fragmented and often esoteric. The diversity of soil organisms is tremendous. The principal organisms include bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, arthropods, nematodes, worms, insects, and mammals. In order to provide a 'state-of-the-science' about soil organisms related to management, a symposium was convened to address soil organism functions and processes, management effects on soil organisms and processes, and describe some roles of soil organisms in restoration and applications for land management. The focus of the symposium was on Pacific Northwest forest and rangeland ecosystems.

AB  - This assessment describes northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) habitat in the State of Utah. Because of fire exclusion, insect and disease epidemics, timber harvest, livestock grazing, or a combination of these factors the forests and woodlands of Utah have changed drastically since the early 1900's. Goshawk habitat in Utah was assessed using potential vegetation types, current vegetation types, and expert knowledge. The present conditions of the forests and woodlands of Utah are prone to insect and disease epidemics in addition to the risk of stand replacing fires. To ensure the goshawk's continued existence in Utah will require the restoration of these degraded habitats and the protection of native processes.

AB  - This assessment describes northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) habitat in the State of Utah. Because of fire exclusion, insect and disease epidemics, timber harvest, livestock grazing, or a combination of these factors the forests and woodlands of Utah have changed drastically since the early 1900's. Forests are now dominated by mid- and late successional species (Douglas-fir, white fir, and subalpine fir) rather than the early successional species (lodgepole and ponderosa pine). Along with these changes came suspected declines in goshawk populations. Goshawk habitat in Utah was assessed using potential vegetation types, current vegetation types, and expert knowledge. Subalpine fir (17 percent) and quaking aspen (10 percent) potential vegetation types were the most common forest types in the State. Nearly 95 percent of the subalpine fir potential vegetation type was rated as high or medium for nesting habitat, while nearly 90 percent of the quaking aspen potential vegetation type was rated as high or medium for nesting. Similarly, combining nesting and foraging preferences 70 percent of the subalpine fir potential vegetation type is rated as either high value or optimum habitat. In addition, throughout Utah all of the high value habitats are well connected. The present conditions of the forests and woodlands of Utah are prone to insect and disease epidemics in addition to the risk of stand replacing fires. To ensure the goshawk's continued existence in Utah will require the restoration of these degraded habitats and the protection of native processes.

AB  - Combination chemotherapy using potent anti-retroviral agents has led to significant advances in the clinical management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. However, the emergence of multiple drug-resistant mutants, the high need for compliance to adhere to demanding drug-dosing schemes, and the remaining toxic side-effects of drugs make the perspective of life-long treatment unattractive and possibly unrealistic. Therefore, means must be sought to shorten the time span during which treatment is necessary. Such means could be to stimulate an efficient immune response during the period of low virus load and restored CD4+ cell levels, which might be capable of keeping the virus under long-lasting control after treatment is stopped. Here we tested this concept of combined chemotherapy/ therapeutic vaccination in a non-human primate model. Rhesus macaques chronically infected with the chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) containing the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) HXBc2 gene for reverse transcriptase (RT) in the genomic background of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)mac239 (RT-SHIV) were treated with (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA), a potent anti-HIV drug. When virus load had decreased significantly, we immunized with SIV genes env, gag/pol, rev, tat, and nef inserted in two different expression vector systems. Four weeks after the second immunization, drug treatment was stopped. Animals were monitored to determine if virus load stayed low or if it increased again to the original levels and if CD4+ T-cell levels remained stable. Humoral and cellular immune responses were also measured. This combined chemotherapy/ therapeutic vaccination regimen induced a significant reduction in the steady-state level of viremia in one out of two chronically infected rhesus macaques. Chemotherapeutic treatment alone did not achieve reduction of viremia in two chronically infected animals. The nature of the immune responses assumed to have been induced by vaccination in one out of the two monkeys remains to be elucidated. © Munksgaard.

AB  - The 1998 ice storm, which caused extensive damage to forests from eastern Ontario to the Canadian Maritimes, led to a variety of economic and ecological questions from governments, concerned publics, and stakeholder groups. Here we outline how the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, working with other organizations, developed short- and longer-term responses to those questions. Efforts have already produced: 1) a low-level aerial storey of forests damaged; 2) extension notes for homeowners, landowners, maple syrup producers, plantation owners, natural resource agencies, and municipalities; 3) information for media and natural resource education groups; 4) standardized techniques and training for assessing damage and making recommendations; 5) literature reviews and synthesis; and 6) management guidelines. In addition, a manipulative experiment in sugar maple stands has been initiated to document: 1) the effects of tapping on sugar maple recovery; 2) the potential of remedial treatments (fertilizer additions alone or in combination) to speed recovery or mitigate further damage; 3) the effects of both damage and potential remedial treatments on sap production; and 4) selected ecological consequences of damage and remedial treatments. Research to examine the effects of damage to woodlots and plantations will: 1) quantify damage in plots representing a variety of forest types, many established and assessed before the storm; 2) examine disease, stain, decay, and insect damage probabilities in broadleaf and conifer stands; 3) document insect responses to damage in red pine plantations; 4) develop economically based decision-support tools for local through regional management decisions, for damaged pine and maple stands; and 5) document the biological and economic consequences of post-damage salvage and 'cleanup' operations. To date, science efforts have provided short-term recommendations related to specific stakeholder concerns, while the research will develop new knowledge related to ice damage and potential remedial treatments.

AB  - Recent shifts in emphasis to preservation of biological diversity and establishment of large nature reserves have resulted in downgrading of the preceived importance of data at the population level. These shifts in emphasis, while laudable, should not result in loss of focus on the fundamental importance of population information. Suitable habitat, although a prime necessity, is not sufficient for wildlife preservation. Species may not occupy otherwise suitable habitat because of internal (predation, interspecific competition, disease) or external (adverse climate, exploitation, disturbance, impact of exotic species, pollution and toxicants) factors. Historical impacts may persist for many years, and may require active restoration. Forest management plans must consider population data on a metapopulation scale. Data for common species can be at the reconnaissance level whereas for threatened or sensitive species they need to be more detailed. To evaluate sustainability, population data must be integrated with forest stand data in projection models to predict habitat-population mosaics at various times in the future. These models must be developed and improved over time in an adaptive management approach.

AB  - In many western Montana ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands, fire suppression and past selective logging of large trees have resulted in conditions favoring succession to dense stands of shade-tolerant, but insect- and disease-prone Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Stand thinning and understory prescribed burning have been proposed as surrogates for pre-Euro-American settlement ecological processes and as potential treatments to improve declining forest condition and reduce the probability of severe wildfire. To test the effectiveness of these silvicultural techniques on overstory and understory conditions, research is ongoing in the Lick Creek Demonstration Site in the Bitterroot National Forest, Montana. Our research examined the response (mortality and vigor) of the dominant browse species, antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) and Scouler's willow (Salix scouleriana), to a ponderosa pine stand restoration project utilizing four treatments: (1) a shelterwood cut that removed 53% of the tree basal area; (2) a shelterwood cut with a low fuel consumption burn; (3) a shelterwood cut with a high fuel consumption burn; and (4) a control. Prior to the application of treatments, 1,856 bitterbrush and 871 willow were located, and their survival and vigor subsequently monitored for 2 yr posttreatment. The cut and burn treatments resulted in the greatest reduction in antelope bitterbrush and Scouler's willow density averaging 66% and 24% of pretreatment density, respectively. The shelterwood cut reduced bitterbrush and Scouler's willow density by 35% and 14%, respectively. On treatments receiving a shelterwood cut (all treatments but the control), but where antelope bitterbrush and Scouler's willow did not have fire damage, mortality was 45% for bitterbrush and 20% for willow, respectively. For bitterbrush and Scouler's willow plants that receivedfire damage, mortality was 72% for bitterbrush and 19% for willow. Although the burn and shelterwood harvest treatments resulted in reduced density of antelope bitterbrush and Scouler's willow 2 yr posttreatment, these treatments increased vigor of both species and created mineral seedbeds that may be necessary for establishment of seedlings.

AB  - From the seat of a biplane a thousand feet above the Florida Keys, the sea seems a boundless place, tranquil but for the froth of breakers on coral reefs and the hues of mingling currents. Yet this blye veneer - like all the world's oceans - is critically threatened by overfishing, pollution, disease, and encroaching humanity. To help protect vital pockets along U.S. coasts, the government has created 12 marine sanctuaries, which include the waters of the Florida Keys. Each site in this living gallery of kelp forests, benthic canyons, coral gardens, and tide pools is a laboratory for the restoration of marine ecosystems - lifeblood of the blue planet.

AB  - The Assessment of Ecosystem Components in the Interior Columbia Basin and Portions of the Klamath and Great Basins provides detailed information about current conditions and trends for the biophysical and social systems within the Basin. This information can be used by land managers to develop broad land management goals and priorities and provides the context for decisions specific to smaller geographic areas. The Assessment area covers about 8 percent of the U.S. land area, 24 percent of the Nation's National Forest System lands, 10 percent of the Nation's BLM-administered lands, and contains about 1.2 percent of the Nation's population. This results in a population density that is less than one-sixth of the U.S. average. The area has experienced recent, rapid population growth and generally has a robust, diverse economy. As compared to historic conditions, the terrestrial, aquatic, forest, and rangeland systems have undergone dramatic changes. Forested landscapes are more susceptible to fire, insect, and disease than under historic conditions. Rangelands are highly susceptible to noxious weed invasion. The disturbance regimes that operate on forest and rangeland have changed substantially, with lethal fires dominating many areas where non-lethal fires were the norm historically. Terrestrial habitats that have experienced the greatest decline include the native grassland, native shrubland, and old forest structures. There are areas within the Assessment area that have higher diversity than others. Aquatic systems are now more fragmented and isolated than historically and the introduction of non-native fish species has complicated current status of native fishes. Core habitat and population centers do remain as building blocks for restoration. Social and economic conditions within the Assessment area vary considerably, depending to a great extent on population, diversity of employment opportunities, and changing demographics. Those counties with the higher population densities and greater diversity of employment opportunities are generally more resilient to'economic downturns. This Assessment provides a rich information base, including over 170 mapped themes with associated models and databases, from which future decisions can benefit.

AB  - Mycorrhizae are important in the functioning of forest ecosystems worldwide, and play a critical role in water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and prevention of feeder root disease. The majority of mycorrhizal research has been conducted on upland sites, especially in coniferous ecosystems and in commercial agricultural production. However, the maintenance and restoration of bottomland hardwood (BLH) forest ecosystems in the southern United States is of increasing concern. Both ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae are present in BLH forests, although the dominance of one or the other type depends primarily on both the tree species and the hydrologie regime. Ectomycorrhizae tend to be more sensitive to flooding, while endomycorrhizal infection can be present even in permanently flooded soils. The mycorrhizae of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and the oaks (Quercus spp.) have been studied most due to their economic importance. Considerable work is still needed to better understand mycorrhizal relationships in BLH ecosystems and associated trees, both with respect to infectivity and nutrient cycling. Such information may be necessary for restoration of BLH forests on old agricultural fields, or to maintain the productivity of BLH forests after harvest. This paper summarizes studies on mycorrhizae relationships in BLH forests and suggests future work necessary for understanding the role mycorrhizae can have in managing these ecosystems.

AB  - The soil-borne plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi is widely distributed in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest of Western Australia. Infested areas of the forest are mined for bauxite and the presence of the pathogen could affect the survival of trees re-established after mining. Monitoring of 21 revegetated bauxite mined areas found that survival of jarrah and marri (Eucalyptus calophylla) trees was high (85-92% and 93-99%, respectively) after 5-7 years but P. cinnamomi was recovered from dead trees. To identify trees for more detailed study, plant symptoms of stress such as suppressed growth, wilting, yellowing of crown, coppice and epicormic growth and visible stem lesions were used. Over a period of 15 months, 30 E. marginata and 28 E. calophylla were carefully excavated and examined for lesions and the presence of P. cinnamomi. P. cinnamomi was consistently isolated from the lignotuber and collar regions of both hosts but never from the roots alone, except in one instance from E. calophylla where it was isolated from a non-lesioned root. In E. calophylla, the lignotuber appears to be very susceptible to invasion by P. cinnamomi in contrast to the roots which appear resistant. The invasion of the pathogen into the lignotuber and collar regions of both species were consistently associated with ponding of water around the plants. This ponding persists for many hours to days after rain and appears to provide an infection court for P. cinnamomi. Development of rehabilitation procedures to reduce this ponding will minimize the risk of tree deaths caused by this pathogen.

AB  - In order to test the effectiveness of captive-rearing and release strategies for future restoration of birds in Hawai'i, this pilot study was conducted in forests where introduced avian disease and mammalian predators were present. Methodology used resulted in the first successful hatching of Drepanidinae eggs in an incubator and subsequent hand-rearing of chicks from hatch. Sixteen Common 'Amakihi (Hemignathus virens virens) (mean hatch weight = 1.4 g) were hand-reared. Two different reintroduction strategies were evaluated for small honeycreepers. Known mortality in the wild after release was due to mosquito-transmitted disease (avian malaria and pox). This pilot study shows that the techniques necessary to hatch, rear, and release endangered Hawaiian honeycreepers are available. However, restoration efforts will probably not succeed unless mosquito-free, predator-controlled reintroduction sites are available or strategies are developed to decrease mortality in naive honeycreepers exposed to disease after release. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - We review current knowledge of the diet and predator-prey relationships of the fetal cat (Felis catus), fox (Vulpes vulpes) and dingo (Canis familiaris dingo) (including wild dogs), and consider how forest fragmentation by roads may influence the use of native forest ecosystems by these species and the significance of this for native fauna. The cat, fox and dingo are significant predators in Australia that interact with native fauna in various ways, including predation, competition for resources, and transmission of disease. On the basis of current knowledge, it is clear that the nature and impact of predation by the cat, fox and dingo on native fauna are primarily determined by prey availability, although there are exceptions to this rule. Generally, dingoes prey upon large to medium-sized prey species (e.g. wallabies, common wombats and possums), foxes prey upon medium-sized to small prey (e.g. possums and rats) and consume a significant component of scavenged material and vegetation, while cats also prey upon medium-sized to small prey, but may have a greater proportion of reptiles and birds in their diet. The cat is generally considered to be an opportunistic predator and to have contributed to the demise of a number of mammals. The fox is considered more of a threat to small native mammals than is the cat and it has been asserted that all species of mammals that fall within the critical weight range (CWR) of 120-5000 g are at risk of local extinction when the fox is present. The severity of the impact of the dingo upon the native fauna is considered to be minimal, at least in comparison with the impact that the cat and fox can have on populations. The dingo is not considered a threat to CWR mammals in undisturbed environments. The fox, fetal cat and dingo are all considered to have the ability to selectively prey upon species and, to some extent, individual sexes and age- classes of a number of larger prey species. Although many of Australia's forested areas are relatively heavily fragmented by roads, there are no published studies specifically investigating the use of roads by fetal predators. Information on the distribution and abundance of foxes, cats and dingoes in these ecosystems, their ecology and their impact on native fauna is particularly limited. Further, the extent to which roads influence the distribution and abundance of these species and the consequences of these for native fauna are poorly known. Given this, we suggest that one of the most important research needs is to establish the relative impact that exotic predators may have on native fauna under varying degrees of road construction within native forests. For example, are areas with and without roads in forests used differently by exotic predators and what is the significance of this in terms of the potential impact on fauna? The extent to which fetal predators forage away from roads needs further investigation, as does the rates of predation within edges, because this may have several consequences for the design, location and size of retained strips and wildlife corridors as well as restoration programmes. Further observations on regional differences influencing predator-prey interactions are required, as is research on the potential impacts on native fauna resulting from prey selection in forests subjected to various degrees of fragmentation and modification.

AB  - Over the fluctuation in population density of tent caterpillars, Malacosoma californicum pluviale and M. disstria, fecundity changes from being high at peak density to low for several years during the decline. During the increase phase, fecundity rapidly returns to moderately high levels with a further increase occurring to-ward the end of the increase phase. Two hypotheses which might explain these shifts are that (1) mortality from viral disease which is common during population declines selects for resistant individuals with low fecundity as an associated characteristic, and (2) sublethal viral disease reduces fecundity of moths during population decline. In this study we observed rapid shifts in the frequencies of large and small egg masses and in the mean fecundity between different phases of the population fluctuation. Viral disease was more common in caterpillars from small egg masses of the forest tent caterpillar. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that sublethal effects of virus reduce the fecundity of moths during the population decline, but high fecundity is quickly restored when disease is rare during the population increase. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Four Thai women relate how they became grassroots leaders and what they expect from the NGO (nongovernmental organization) Forum of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women. Somboon Srikhumdokkhae's story began when her health began to fail at age 29 after 12 years of work in a textile factory. It took her four years of searching to find the proper diagnosis and treatment for her condition, which she learned was byssinosis, a lung disease caused by her occupation. Srikhumdokkhae soon found others suffering from byssinosis, and she joined with fellow employees to produce a newsletter telling other workers about the problem. This led to the formation of workers' groups and to demands for compensation. Srikhumdokkhae hopes that the WCW will contribute to national labor movement efforts to alleviate such problems. Ing Thawaisin's stance against a government relocation scheme that affected her village propelled her into grassroots environmental advocacy. The government wished to move low-income people dependent upon forests in order to plant eucalyptus trees. After successfully protesting the scheme, Thawaisin works with an organization dedicated to preserving and replanting the forest. Thawaisin believes that women have become involved in grassroots environmental advocacy because they look after their whole community as their family. Thawaisin hopes to exchange views with women from around the world and learn from their experiences during the NGO Forum of the WCW and to warn women in neighboring countries of the dangers of material development. Miya Hawa learned about the ecological value of sea grass and mangrove swamps from the Raindrop Association. By restoring the health of the sea, Hawa and her conservation group have attracted more fish to the area and have improved the quality of their lives. Hawa feels that attending the NGO Forum will empower her personally and will help her to understand the link between development and increased poverty. Dokmai Prueksamas, a dressmaker, suffered as a battered wife for seven years. Her association with a Women's Club led her to realize that she was not alone and that she could solve her problems without resorting to violence herself. Now she counsels other women. Prueksamas looks forward to the conference in Beijing as her first foray into the international arena.

AB  - Euro-American settlement of the Inland Westhas altered forest and woodland landscapes, species composition, disturbance regimes, and resource conditions. Public concern over the loss of selected species and unique habitats (e.g., old-growth) has caused us toneglect the more pervasive problem of declining ecosystem health. Population explosions of trees, exotic weed species, insects, diseases, and humans are stressing natural systems. In particular, fire exclusion, grazing, and timber harvest have created anomalous ecosystem structures, landscape patterns, and disturbance regimes that are not consistent with the evolutionary history of the indigenous biota. Continuation of historical trends of climate change, modified atmospheric chemistry, tree density increases, and catastrophic disturbances seems certain. However, ecosystem management strategies including the initiation of management experiments can facilitate the adaptation of both social and ecological systems to these anticipated changes. A fairly narrow window of opportunity-perhaps 15-30 years-exists for land managers to implement ecological restoration treatments. © 1994 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heavy livestock grazing, logging, and fire exclusion associated with Euro-American settlement has brought about substantial changes in forest conditions in westernforests. Thus, old-growth definitions basedon current forest conditions may not be compatible with the natural conditions prevalent throughout the evolutionary history ofwestern forest types. Detailed analysis ofdata from two study areas in the southwestern ponderosa pine type suggests that averagetree densities have increased from as fewas23trees per acre in presettlement timesto as many as 851 trees per acre today. Associated with these increases in tree density are increases in canopy closure, verticalfuel continuity, and surface fuel loadings resulting in fire hazards over large areas never reached before settlement. In addition, fire exclusion and increased tree density has likely decreased tree vigor (increasing mortality from disease, insect, drought, etc.), herbaceous and shrub production, aestheticvalues, water availability and runoff, and nutrient availability, and alsochanged soil characteristics and altered wildlife habitat. To remedy these problems and restore these forest ecosystems to more nearlynatural conditions, and maintain a viable cohort ofold age-class trees, it willbe necessary tothin out most of the postsettlement trees, manually remove heavy fuelsfrom the base oflarge, old trees, and reintroduce periodic burning. © 1994 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB  - This report is volume IV of the Eastside forest ecosystem assessment. Portions of forest ecosystem in E Oregon and Washington are in poor health, are not meeting society's expectations, and have elevated hazard for fire, insects, and disease. Diversity in stream habitats and associated fisheries has declined over the last several decades in several drainage basins, requiring conservation and restoration efforts in key watersheds. Required first steps in restoring forest and aquatic ecosystems are the immediate reduction in hazard for catastrophic loss of biodiversity, site quality, resource commodities, and improved conditions for public health. We need to simultaneously re-establish ecosystem processes and disturbance effects that create and maintain desired sustainable ecosystems, while conserving genetic, species, community, and landscape diversity and long-term site productivity. Restoration of stressed sites is site specific, but the context for the action should be defined by the desired condition(s) of the next higher landscape scale and achieved desired positive cumulative effects over time. Restoration actions should be consistent with the desired level of disturbance effects required to maintain sustainable ecosystems, and standards and guides should reflect the inherent variability associated with dynamic systems. -from Editor

Next, there are six papers on ecological and historical perspectives: restoration of old-growth ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa forests; the roles of succession, forest nutrition, nutrient cycling and nutrient management in forest health; the integrated roles of insects, diseases, and decomposers in fire-dominated forests; assessing forest health using forest inventory data; and conceptual origins of catastrophic forest mortality. Four papers then look at processes, models and tools: a procedure for landscape characterization; emphasis areas as an alternative to buffer zones; wildlife habitat models and the use of remote sensing and GIS; and an ecological framework for forest health planning. The last section reviews management and policy issues: a policy case study in SW Idaho; silviculture, fire and ecosystem management; maintaining and creating old-growth structural features; forest health and wildlife habitat management in the Boise National Forest, Idaho; advance regeneration; and beyond even- vs. uneven-aged management. -S.R.Harris

AB  - The European settlement of Australia began in 1788. Australian history itself can almost be thought of as the history of its land settlement process into the inland areas. Problems of the settlement and the settlement process of Australia have been actively studied in historical geography. In this paper the author reviews studies of the exploitation of the wheat belt in South Australia. The first remarkable change of Australian landscape after European settlement was the clearance of forests, woodlands and scrub. The agricultural land spread from the coastal plains to the inland areas after the clearance of native vegetation. Harris' map, based on air photographs, shows the vegetation clearance within the agricultural land of South Australia up until the mid-1970s. The map shows that nearly three-quarters of the land has been stripped. The abundance of agricultural land resulted from a severe decrease in native vegetation. Since the first European settlement, Australia was adversely affected by drought. The more the agricultural land spread into the inland areas, the greater affect these droughts had on the wheat belt. In particular, severe droughts occurred after the 1920s in the southern part of Australia, and substantial damage was done to crops and sheep. Farmers suffered from the decrease in crop yields. In early times, on the wheat belt in the southern part of Australia, farmers continued to plant only wheat every year. But the soil fertility decreased gradually until the end of the 19th century. Donald reports that the wheat yield in the southern part of Australia declined from 12.8 bushels per acre in the 1860s to 10.8 bushels in the 1870s, to 8.3 bushels in the 1880s and finally to a desperately low 7.3 bushels in the 1890s. To restore soil fertility, farmers introduced a wheat-fallow system of farming by the early 20th century. With this system, the wheat yield rose to 9.8 bushels in the 1900s, to 10.7 bushels in the 1910s and to 12.0 bushels in the 1920s. Although the yields rose from 7.3 to 12.0 bushels, the system proved unstable, and, in many districts of the southern part of Australia, there was a decline in crop yield from 1920 onwards, because of severe droughts and the extension of wheat growing into climatically and edaphically marginal lands. The next new farming system, "ley farming" or "pasture legumes", was introduced into the wheat belt after the mid 1930s. Ley farming is an integrated system of cereal and livestock production. Farmers grow wheat, barley and oats on part of their agricultural land, while sheep and cattle graze the pasture legumes. With the introduction of ley farming, production in the wheat belt increased rapidly. The wheat yield rose from around 12-13 bushels in the 1930s and 1940s to above 17 bushels in the 1960s. By 1950, annual legumes, mainly medics and clovers, were chosen and sown, and the ley farming system had diffused over the wheat belt of South Australia and the other parts of Australia. But other factors, such as disease and soil erosion, have limited yield increase especially after the 1970s. For the comprehensive reconstruction of the details of changing landscapes in the Australian Wheat belt after the exploitation of its lands, it is necessary to analyse the relations between the European settlement process and the progress of the farming system. © 1992, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

AB  - To assess the ecological consequences of selective logging in the major rainforest areas in Australia, past studies are reviewed with respect to the following: recovery of stand structure; regeneration capacity; individual tree growth and species composition of stands; hydrologie impact; floristics; wildlife; soil nutrient levels; fire susceptibility; and incursion of weeds and diseases. Although rainforest logging has become a sensitive issue in the community and its effects are of concern to ecologists, relatively few scientific studies of selective logging have been published. Thus, the full nature and extent of ecological changes to Australian rainforests due to this form of disturbance cannot yet be determined. However, some cautious interpretation of the studies that have been completed is possible. Following a single selective logging, the changes indicated by individual studies often appeared to be relatively minor. It is suggested that many of these effects are not extensive or irreversible and might not persist beyond structural recovery of the rainforest. However, two changes were identified as likely to persist beyond structural recovery. These are: a post‐logging difference in the proportional representation of major overstorey tree species and a reduction in the numbers of large‐diameter trees. Further, results indicate that more extensive and longer‐lasting changes may result from multiple selective loggings, especially if the time between successive loggings is short. Even with light logging intensities, a conservative interval of at least 60 years between selective loggings, to allow canopy and below‐canopy conditions to be restored, is indicated. Apart from disturbance frequency, the studies reviewed raise questions as to whether long‐term natural disturbance effects per se are distinguishable from long‐term selective logging effects. A need for further work is highlighted. Overall, there appears to be a distinction between the recovery capability of the more northerly mainland rainforests and those of Tasmania. Slower growth in the more southerly rainforests, compounded by a geographical susceptibility to summer drought, increases the possibility of fire damage following selective logging.

AB  - Although it seems to be a generally accepted assumption that the widespread forest decline is triggered by different factors working in different ways, additional aspects must be taken into account to understand the recent disease events of central European forests. Air pollutants can interact with natural stressors and site conditions can modify the reactions of trees to air pollution, and in view of this the ambivalent roles of site factors, natural stressors and air contaminants in predisposing trees to diseases are discussed. A comprehensive eco-stress hypothesis is described, which postulates that forest ecosystems become increasingly sensitive to external stressors when the load of intrinsic stress is elevated. Central European forests are mostly ecologically unstable, suffering from their historical fates and from the effects of recent management methods. Their sensitivity to additional external stressors is, therefore, expected to be very high. A double strategy of forest conservation in central Europe is suggested: reduction of air pollution and restoration of the intrinsic stability of forest ecosystems. © 1990.

AB  - Pinus albicaulis is a valuable wildlife resource in the W US and SW Canada. Its large seeds are a preferred food for a variety of birds and mammals, especially Clark's nutcrackers Nucifraga columbiana, red squirrels Tamiasciurus hudsonicus and bears. Whitebark pine communities provide food and shelter for nongranivorous species as well. In many areas, whitebark pine populations are being depleted by advancing forest succession and insect and disease epidemics. Extensive numbers of whitebark pine were lost to mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae in the Intermountain West in the 1970s and early 1980s. Dwarf mistletoe Arceuthobium spp. is a significant source of mortality in some parts of California, Oregon, Nevada and Wyoming. Whitepine blister rust Cronartium ribicola has killed much of the whitebark pine in portions of the Inland Northwest. Widespread losses of this species have a variety of implications for management issues such as the restoration of grizzly bear Ursus arctos horribilis populations. -from Authors

AB  - These Regulations set forth the administration and duties of various government departments under the Mexican Forest Law. They provide that the National Forest Administration is, among other things, to promote operations designed for the conservation, protection, and restoration of forest resources, especially with respect to disasters of any kind that affect forests, such as pestilence, fires, disease, floods, and acid rain, as well as other destructive and contaminating elements. Further provisions of the Regulations describe efforts to aid reforestation and silviculture to be undertaken by the Secretariat and activities with respect to use permits and forest management. In its efforts to aid reforestation, the Secretariat is to establish nurseries, give assistance to local bodies to establish nurseries, and support reforestation programs financially. Regulations of the General Law on Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection with Respect to Environmental Impact of 6 June 1988 contain provisions requiring the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology to formulate general rules on the environmental impact involved in the use of forests. These rules are to set forth measures on prevention, improvement, preservation, restoration, and control. The Secretariat is also to issue ecological protection restrictions on the use of forest resources, which are to be relied on in the evaluation of proposed forest use projects. The Regulations also set forth procedures to be followed in examining use permit applications and information that must be included in such applications.

AB  - Intraperitoneal infection with the avirulent A7(74) strain of the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) induces an immune mediated demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The blood and brain virus titres, the serum antibody titres and the histopathological changes in the brains of normal mice and mice immunosuppressed with 5.0 or 8.0 Gy total body irradiation (TBX) were determined. SFV infection of immunosuppressed mice resulted in persistently high blood and brain virus titres, neuronal pycnosis, paralysis and death. No demyelination or central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response occurred in these immunosuppressed mice despite high and persistent brain virus titres. The CNS inflammatory response and associated demyelination could be restored to infected immunosuppressed mice by adoptive transfer of spleen cells, and these changes were brought forward if the donor spleen cells were from mice previously sensitized to SFV. The results indicate that the immune response following SFV A7(74) infection is both protective and pathogenic, and that the demyelination is immune mediated and does not result from direct viral destruction of oligodendrocytes, or any other direct effect of the virus.

AB  - Results of two large-scale surveys of Ixodes persulcatus distribution were compared. Surveys were conducted in a south taiga forest area in the Khabarovsk region two and ten years after a great fire. The direct inhibiting effect of the fire on the population of I. persulcatus was not continuous though apparent. By the moment of pyrogenic small forests formation on slash fires, i.e. during the period not exceeding 2-3 complete developmental cycles of I. persulcatus, the abundance and spatial structure of its population are restored completely.

AB  - Virus-infected animals and those bearing various types of malignancies progressively lose their ability to respond to interferon inducers. The interferon response of virus-infected animals could be restored to normal levels when inducers were administered with certain prostaglandins. This suggests that prostaglandins may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of interferon inducers as antiviral and antineoplastic agents. Copyright © 1978 AAAS.

AB  - The method of direct extermination of the main vector of the tickborne encephalitis (TBE), is widely used in the USSR to protect the human population against the disease. The method consists of a single treatment of forest with DDT. It is only DDT that produced a high effect. The paper summaries the results of 20 years of observations. A high effect of exterminating ticks (98.8 ± 0.7%), the persistence of effect for 6-20 years (most commonly for 12-15 years), and destruction of local tick populations were observed. A high protection of the human population against TBE was achieved. The process of restoration of the exterminated tick population was studied. The negative effect of treatment with DDT was observed in many invertebrates, partially in Soricidae and only 5 species of birds. The populations of the affected species, exept I. persulcatus, were restored in 2-4 years. Retreatments were found to be necessary after 10-15 years. The circulation of TBE virus was disturbed initially but restored by the 7th season. DDT residues were found 11-13 afterwards but their amount was toxic for various species only for 1-3 seasons. The foregoing suggests that at present the use of DDT for control of I. persulcatus is possible, but requires strict epidemiological indications. Further, it is desirable to substitute DDT with a similar but not cumulative drug with a greater selective effect on I. persulcatus, as well as to develop biological methods of control.

AB  - This book is intended to demonstrate the existence of a deep underlying core of principles to which all aspects of environmental science can contribute and from which each can draw. Most particularly, it reflects the recent strong shift of emphasis in ecology to examination of processes in terms of the efficiency of energy transfer in systems. Each branch of ecology and environmental science is examined to determine what bodies of theory it could contribute to the entire field. Thus, an effort is made to integrate plant with animal ecology, and forestry, fisheries, agriculture, and range management with both of them. Chapter 1 introduces the essential background material. Chapter 2, the key to the design of the book, details fourteen principles which constitute the core theory of environmental science, as the subject is currently understood. Chapter 3, 4, and 5 present the core of classical ecological theory. Chapter 5 puts considerable emphasis on the biological consequences of variations in upper atmosphere turbidity produced by volcanoes, because of the importance of this phenomenon in accounting for certain cycles, and also because it illustrates the effects of air pollution. Chapter 6 stresses the role of main in ecological systems, particularly with respect to the fundamental differences between the effects of man and natural phenomena. Chapters 7 to 11 treat a series of ecosystems, about each of which a great deal is known. These include: the lake, the forest, the watershed, grassland and range system, and agricultural systems. Each is selected as a model system peculiarly suitable to illustrate certain types of principles and problems. Biological control is discussed in Chapter 12 to demonstrate that where natural balances are imperfect, immature, or have been disturbed by man, it may sometimes be possible to restore them through application of ecological theory, by means of biological control. Disease is treated in Chapter 13. Finally, chapters 14 and 15 are intended to show how the basic science of ecology can be applied to a fundamental understanding of man's current position in the world. The analysis leads to a global strategy for mankind in the last chapter. This book is intended for courses that can be taken by any university student as soon as he enters the university. Although some fairly complex ideas are presented, in all cases an attempt is made to present them as photographs, graphs or diagrams.

AB  - The impact of fire on the environment of the various Sierran conifer forests varies with intensity and frequency. Generally, however, fire (1) prepares a seedbed; (2) cycles nutrients within the system; (3) adjusts the successional pattern; (4) modifies conditions affecting wildlife; (5) influences the mosaic of age classes and vegetation types; (6) alters the numbers of trees susceptible to disease and insects; and (7) both reduces and creates fire hazards. Natural fire frequency apparently coincides with levels of fuel accumulation that result in burns of relatively low intensity at frequent intervals. This may average 8 yr in mixed conifer forests, although frequencies from 4 to 20 yr or more are found in particular sites. In all probability, giant sequoia and various pines of the Sierra survive today because of the role fire plays in the various forest types. National Park Service management policies are aimed at restoring fire, as nearly as possible, to its natural role in Sierran conifer forests. This is being accomplished by prescribed burning at lower and middle elevation types and by allowing lightning fires to burn in higher elevation forests. © 1973.

AB  - Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands causes production losses and threatens future yields from the jarrah forest. No means of eradicating the pathogen are foreseeable. Action to maintain production and reduce timber losses involves slowing down the rate of spread of the disease by planned, concentrated logging, efficient salvage and hygiene measures. Infected areas are being planted with tolerant species to restore them to a high level of production. Uninfected jarrah stands of high growth potential are being treated to maximise production of high quality timber and reduce susceptibility to infection. Research and education are integral parts of this management programme. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
